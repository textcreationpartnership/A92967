            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE and SCOPE.</head>
            <p>THis Diſcourſe was written more large, and it may be, leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but the Authors diſtance from the Preſs, and little time to correct it, with ſo many numbers, and other occaſions, prevailed to contract and croud it out as he could; being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for private Friends, and ſuch as can excuſe both matter and manner.</p>
            <p>The firſt is to expreſs ſome little part of the unexpreſſable Goodneſs of God, and <hi>Love of Chriſt, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> and to help ſhed it abroad into our hearts, that it may mould us into love, to God, and all men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have we not all One Father? Hath not One God created us? Why do we then deal treacherouſly every man againſt his brother, by prophaning the Covenant of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Saviour did not only bid them all ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> but repeated it, and preſſed it on the multitude, that they had All, <hi>One Father in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>One Maſter,</hi> or Teacher, even Chriſt which is twice repeated, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>And as Love was his laſt and great Command, on Earth; ſo his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint out of Heaven, was of ſome that had <hi>loſt their firſt Love.</hi> And may he not complain that we have loſt All Love? which is not only waxen cold, but even Dead, and quite put out, by Luſt, or Love of the World, and Cares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which himſelf ſaid, would <hi>Choak the good Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what Hope is left, or means to recover us, but in himſelf, <hi>Made under the Law</hi> of Love, to God, and Man alſo? So that it is written in his heart, to <hi>Love his God, and his Neighbour As him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> To propagate the Name, and Love of God, with All his Might: and to bring his Children, Servants, and the Strangers in his Gate, to Reſt the Reſt of God: as is required in the fourth Command.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing he bid it be written, as a <hi>True Saying of God,</hi> that He would make <hi>All Things New;</hi> the Author doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, though he doth not yet ſee it. And he thought it worth enquiring, When, That great Change is to come, into the minds of Men<hi>:</hi> to mould them into Love, of God, and One another.</p>
            <p>And finding the Pſalm <hi>for the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> to tell us, that God will appear in his Glory, when he buildeth up <hi>Zion:</hi> and when the Peoples are <hi>Gathered,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdoms to ſerve the Lord:</hi> he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, what the Law, or the Prophets ſay of ſuch a Gathering.</p>
            <p>And he found that <hi>Moſes</hi> Dying Charge, on <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> with ſucceeded Kings of Iſrael (which he hopes may come to Chriſt at length) <hi>was to gather All Iſrael and their Strangers alſo;</hi> and to Read the Law to them All; that they may Hear and Learn, and fear the Lord <hi>(and his Goodneſs in the Latter Dayes)</hi> At the end of Seven years; in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the year of Releaſe; in the Feaſt of Tabernacles: which they call the <hi>Feaſt of In Gathering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although this was acted every 7th year in ſome meaſure; yet ſeeing God himſelf doth ſometimes uſe a Day for a Year (or a year for as many years as it hath Dayes) he began to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it might not be So in This alſo: that the Sabbatical years of Releaſe, might intimate their Releaſe from all their
<pb facs="tcp:152720:3"/>
Scatterings, and Bondage, at the Cloſe of ſeven Prophetick years; or in 2555 years, which are ſeven times 365.</p>
            <p>And firſt he found, that ſo many years, After the Fall, did bring Iſrael to reſt, in <hi>Canaan:</hi> and ſo many more, did bring the Chriſtians to reign in Jeruſalem: and that from their Firſt Scatterings, out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in <hi>Jorams</hi> time (when they were firſt led Captive) ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years came out, about 1666, now coming: and from following ſcatterings after <hi>Joram,</hi> ſo many years are out about 1690: and that <hi>Daniels</hi> greateſt number of 2300 dayes, or years, is then alſo finiſhed, from the time of his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
            <p>And for beginning thoſe Prophetick years, about the time of <hi>Joram,</hi> there are many reaſons, beſides their firſt ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Then. For it was a very Great Change of the World; or, as the Jews expreſs it, a <hi>New World;</hi> which they believed to be ſeven or eight times renewed: As the old <hi>Tuſcans</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (in <hi>Plutarchs Sylla)</hi> and that every ſuch New World, was foreſhewn, by Great Prodigies, in Heaven and Earth: yea and Divers times by ſignal Tydes, or Turnings, and Partings, of Waters; as the great <hi>Clepſydra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, at the firſt Creation: and again, at the Flood: and again, at paſſing the Red-Sea; and at entring <hi>Canaan:</hi> When <hi>Jordan</hi> was divided: As again, by <hi>Elijahs</hi> Mantle, At His Aſcenſion (a little before <hi>Joram)</hi> which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their firſt Captivity: As their Laſt, followed our Saviours Aſcenſion; ſhadowed by <hi>Elijahs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire was Then ſhaken and broken, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> by the <hi>Philiſtines, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> which Then firſt revolted, and broke <hi>Jacobs Yoak</hi> (as was foretold by <hi>Iſaac)</hi> and reſted not, till it forced <hi>Ahaz,</hi> to hire <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which deſtroyed Iſrael a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> (who might be ſhadowed by <hi>Rummili,</hi> or <hi>Remaliah)</hi> that in the mask or vizor of Religion, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed 683 Virgins; or 783; as it was 683 years, before the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt Raviſhed the <hi>Virgin of Zion;</hi> and 783 before they crucified Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From that time, the Prophets began to threaten <hi>Edom;</hi> by which the Jews ſay, they meant <hi>Rome:</hi> as in that Map of Hell, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34. directed againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> and the <hi>Raemim,</hi> or <hi>Romim,</hi> v. 7.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Judahs</hi> breach, and cutting off, might be Typed, by <hi>Athaliahs</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Royal Seed (as <hi>Joram</hi> had cut off his brethren) ſo might thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Great years of Scattering, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, be Typed in the ſeven years of Famine, and Wandring of the Widow, (who then Returned, and found the K. talking with <hi>Gehazi:</hi> freed, it ſeems from his Leproſy:) And by the ſeven years of <hi>Joaſh</hi> Hiding, and then coming up and repairing the Temple: and by many other ſeven years, which are here touched.</p>
            <p>In this ſearch of Times, it is found that 1260, or 1290, and 1335 (which are the Great Numbers in <hi>Dan.</hi> and the <hi>Revel.)</hi> may be Years, and Dayes, and Hours, of Jewiſh years.</p>
            <p>As from the Day of Trying the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lambs, or Preparation of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, To the Pentecoſt: Or from the day of <hi>Aarons</hi> Death, and of burning the City, and Temple, To the Day of Creation, or Dedication of the ſecond Temple, and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Time; and to the Feaſt of Trumpets, in the ſeventh Month (which was for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and Tabernacles) were 1260, 1290, or 1335 Hours.</p>
            <p>And from the City Taken, on the <hi>9th</hi> of the <hi>4th</hi> Month, to the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, were 2300 Hours (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:152720:3"/>
the Suns Apogeum, and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox: And their great Releaſe was, in 2300 Dayes.</p>
            <p>As their Releaſe of Hirelings, or their three years Tythes and Offerings, with the Solemn Confeſſions of <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. came out in 1260, or 1335 Dayes.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Davids New Jeruſalem</hi> was gotten from the <hi>Jebuſites, who Trod it down</hi> (as their name in Heb:) And the Ark was fixed in <hi>Zion,</hi> and the Temple built, in 1260, 1290, or at moſt, in 1335 years, from the firſt Deſolation of the Flood.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Nehemiahs New Jeruſalem</hi> was finiſhed, and dedicated, at 1260 hours, (that is the morning of the 53<hi>d</hi> day) from its beginning: but 1335 hours, from his coming thither (as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 11. &amp; 6. 15.) and in ſo many years from <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſervice in <hi>Syria</hi> (Typing Iſrael in <hi>Aſſyria)</hi> or from <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bonds in <hi>Egypt;</hi> or Iſraels coming and Dying there.</p>
            <p>And the great Dedication, and Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, after <hi>Antiochus</hi> &amp; <hi>Nicanor,</hi> was ſo many Dayes (as in <hi>Daniel)</hi> After the City Prophaned; and ſo many years After Egypt, and the Golden Calf: which was 1335 years before the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> which were 1290 years, After the Ark at <hi>Shiloh:</hi> or 1260 years After their firſt Bondage to the K. of <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia</hi> (as a Type of Babylon) and 1260 years, Before the Chriſtians got Jeruſalem, and Reigned in it, about 1100 of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All which were but Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the New Jeruſalem, to come in thoſe degrees, of 1260, 1290, or 1335 years, After the Abominable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, made by Antichriſt, who was Typed out by <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
            </p>

Which laſted as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, as there were Hours in ten Dayes (As the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſaith, they ſhould have <hi>Tribulation for Ten Dayes)</hi> which have Hours 240. and there were ſo many Years, from the firſt Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which began with the Jewiſh War in 65 or 66 of Chriſt) Till <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Times of <hi>Julian,</hi> were as ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Paſchal Lambs, which were Tyed up on the tenth day (ending at Hour 240) and ſlain on the fourteenth, at Hour 333: As <hi>Julian</hi> was 333 years After Chriſt, and <hi>Romes</hi> deadly Wound was, After <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſack'd, 333 years: As <hi>Hamans Lots,</hi> or <hi>Purim,</hi> from the Preparation of the Paſſover, 333 dayes.</p>
            <p>333 was a ſignal Number to the Jews (both for Hours, to the Paſſover, and Dayes, to <hi>Purim;</hi> and Cubits, in the Holy Courts) and to Others alſo. As <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves in <hi>Fabius;</hi> finding Secrets in the Sybils, not to be uttered, and vowing 333 Seſterces, and 333 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</p>

            </p>
            <p>333 is half 666; and 333 Dayes, are 12 Times 666 Hours; which are the Monthly Change of the Sun, and Moon; and thence, the Great Number of Change, to the World, and in Years alſo: As it was to Carthage, in <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus;</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other places, here diſcuſſed.</p>

of Hours; with diverſe Nations (long before they be ſpecifyed in <hi>Polibius</hi> or <hi>Plutarch;</hi> who yet can tell us the firſt Hour of <hi>Romulus)</hi> and the Great account of Hours among the Jews, whoſe Year is a Model of time in All Ages. So that the old Patriarchs, and all the great things of Scripture, were in Harmony to the Dayes and Hours, of the Jewiſh Year; and to the Site and Motions of the Heavenly Bodies.</p>
            <p>As Hours are made by the Moon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 24 of her Diameters, in 24 Hours; and the Earths Diameter, 24 times in the Suns; which may be diſtant from the Earth, twice 666 Radij; As the Moon 66; and <hi>Canaans</hi> Longitude is 65 or 66, in <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the firſt Heavenly body, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Earth, 65 of its Radij, and the firſt Fruits of Earth, were at 65 Hours of Creation, in the 3<hi>d</hi> Day (which was the firſt of Herbs and Animals) ſo the Feaſt of the Firſt fruits, was the <hi>65th</hi> Day of the Year; and in the 3<hi>d</hi> Month, As the Tabernacles twice 65, or 130 Dayes, After Pentecoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was about 130 Hours of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Seth</hi> at 130 years (as many reckon <hi>Abraham</hi> was After <hi>Terah,</hi> 130 years) in which time the Equinox Changeth a whole Day, as 12 Hours in 65 Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enos</hi> was born at 235 Years of the World: and the Paſchal Lambs were Tyed up and Tryed at 235 Hours of the Jewiſh year: and the Great Cycle of the Moon, called the Golden Number, is of 235 Months. For which, Here is an eaſier way to reckon the Moons Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Suns Cycle, with the Dayes of the Week, in any year of Chriſt, or of the Julian Period.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kainan</hi> was born at 325 years of the World: and 325 Hours of their year, came to the Morning Sacrifice of the Paſſover, ſlain at Hour 333; juſt half 666: and <hi>Kainans</hi> Birth was 666 Years before <hi>Enochs</hi> Tranſlation; or twice 666 before the Flood.</p>

               <hi>Mahalael,</hi> as many years, After <hi>Kai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> as there were Hours, to the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice of the third Day: As the Firſt Fruit <hi>Omer,</hi> heaved up, on the 3<hi>d</hi> Day After the Paſſover.</p>
            <p>He was born 1260 (as <hi>Kainan</hi> 1332) before the Flood, and dyed in the year of the World, 1290.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jared,</hi> the 6 from <hi>Adam,</hi> was born 135, and lived 187 years After <hi>Kainan:</hi> and the Morning Sacrifice of the <hi>6th</hi> Day of the World, and of the Month and Year (and ſo of the Firſt fruit <hi>Omer,</hi> from the Tying of the Paſchal Lambs) was at Hour 135: and the Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the <hi>8th</hi> Day (for Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Chriſtian Sabbath) was at hour 187.</p>
            <p>As from Pentecoſt, to the Great <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> there were Dayes 135: and to the Great Atonement, Dayes 187: As between the Vernal and Autumnal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox, 187: and in the Pentateuch 187 Chapters.

            <p>And <hi>Kainan</hi> was twice 365 before <hi>Noah,</hi> 365 before <hi>Jareds</hi> End: As <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halaels</hi> was before the Flood; and the Flood before <hi>Abrahams</hi> Call (if born at his Fathers 70) As Hours of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh year, to the Firſt fruit <hi>Omer:</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped After 360 Hours, and before 366; the midnight of their 16th day: when it was to be Heaved up, After 365 Hours: As <hi>Enoch</hi> was, After he had lived 365 years (as dayes of a year) and begat his Son at 65, as dayes to Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt: and the next came at 187, as

            <p>The Ark was begun at <hi>Noahs</hi> 480, (as the Temple at 480 from <hi>Egypt:</hi> and the Great Day of Unleavened Bread began at Hour 480) but of the World, 1536; and Hour 1536, began the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, which they ſay continued through the 70th day.</p>
            <p>Which began at Hour 1656, as the Flood in the year 1656: And its firſt 40 dayes Rain, may be Types of the firſt 40 years of the ſecond Ark, in the Wilderneſs, before it came to reſt at <hi>Shiloh;</hi> in as many years after the firſt Ark began, as there are Hours in 40 Dayes, which are 960.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Pentecoſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> was as many years after <hi>Enoch,</hi> as there were Hours in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> year to Pentecoſt, or its Preparation.</p>
            <p>And from the firſt Pentecoſt in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> To the Times of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the <hi>Caldean</hi> Sack, or Deſolation by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> or by the <hi>Romans</hi> (and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) were as many Years, as Hours, between the Pentecoſt and Dayes, on which thoſe Deſolations happened.</p>
            <p>And if we may not gueſs at things to come, by what is paſt (in all the World and Works of God in all ages) yet we may ſay, that 1666 After Chriſt, is as many years, After their firſt Pentecoſt in <hi>Canaan</hi> (or firſt coming to it) as there were Hours from Pentecoſt to the feaſt of Tabernacles, that is 3120: for they entered <hi>Canaan</hi> 1455 years before Chriſt, and 1665 more, do make 3120: as Hours in 130 dayes, from Pentecoſt to the feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
            <p>Or if any pleaſe to reckon from ſome latter Pentecoſt: As That in Acts 2. we may find it As many years from <hi>Egypt,</hi> (and their coming thence) as there were Hours in the Jewiſh year, to Pentecoſt, or its Preparation.</p>
            <p>And 1666 will be as many years Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Pentecoſt in Acts 2. as there were Hours from Pentecoſt, to their Great Dooms day, againſt their Entring into Reſt, and of Burning both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: on the <hi>9th</hi> or <hi>10th</hi> of the <hi>5th</hi> Mon.</p>
            <p>But the Author rather thinketh that already paſt, and fulfilled in the <hi>Roman</hi> Sack of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Burning the laſt Temple; which was as many years Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their firſt Pentecoſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as That Day is Hours from the firſt Hour of Pentecoſt; and as many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe times of Chriſt, as there are Hours from their Dooms day, To the Feaſt of Tabernacles: which can be, but 1600, After 69 of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſhew, the Feaſt of Tabernacles (or Gods Tabernacle with men) After the great Harveſt, and Vintage alſo: which ran out from the City (Sacked, or Troden in That Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) 1600 Furlongs: as Apoc. 14.</p>
            <p>And although Furlongs may ſeem to repreſent Months, or other times, as well as Years (as there are much about 1600 Months in the Jewiſh Wars, till <hi>Adrian</hi> raced the City) yet they are moſt proper for years; of which there are many inſtances.</p>
            <p>As Cubits are moſt proper for Dayes (of 24 Hours, as They had 24 Digits) So the Cubits of the Ark do make the very years of the Ark Driven by the Flood, out of the Dragons mouth: from 1250 to 1335.</p>
            <p>As the years between the firſt and the ſecond Ark at <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> New Jeruſalem, with the firſt Temple. Or from <hi>Jacobs</hi> Service, <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bonds, or <hi>Iſraels</hi> Bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> New Jeruſalem.</p>

            <p>Which was 1495 years before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; As the very Number of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Alphabet (by which God wrote the Law) is juſt 1495; and ſo parted, as the years from <hi>Egypt.</hi>

            <p>And if <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Reed do repreſent a Week, 25000 (in the length of its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Portion) make about 480 years; As between the Tabernacle Raiſed, and the Temple: or at moſt 490; As in <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks: Of which more in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. With Paralels between the Kings of the North and South; till <hi>Rome</hi> devoured all; and ſo became the King that ſhould exalt and magnifie himſelf above every god; as <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36.

            </p>
            <p>But the Eaſt or <hi>Perſia,</hi> with the North, or <hi>Tartary,</hi> with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> or other Northern Princes, ſhall Trouble him ſore: and though he ſhall come out with a great Army, and with greater Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then before, yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him.</p>
            <p>And his Palace is placed between the Seas; rightly called <hi>The Port:</hi> and between the Holy Mountains, which all Ages placed in <hi>Thrace,</hi> or ſome Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the Holy Land.</p>
            <p>Which was to be conquered by <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> or <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill call them. And we do not only read of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> mocking <hi>Iſaac</hi> (till he was driven out to Thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, where the <hi>Saracens</hi> aroſe) but the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſhews us a Map of this; in <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> cutting off the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Iſrael in the <hi>7th</hi> Month: and in that very ſeaſon, when thoſe <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> did take <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> upon the 2<hi>d</hi> or 3<hi>d</hi> day of the <hi>7th</hi> Month: on which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill faſt, for <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> ſlaying <hi>Geda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Jerem</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iſhmael</hi> alſo was chaſed away (as before) by <hi>Johanan, the Grace of God:</hi> which at length ſhall be the Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.

THat God Loved <hi>Adam</hi> ſo, that he could not leave him for Ever, I believe: in part:</p>
            <p>From that he ſaith: of the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> and her cruell folly to her Eggs: and of the <hi>Bears, Dragons, Ouls,</hi> and worſt of Creatures, to their young Ones: and of a Woman, to the Son of her womb. And yet, <hi>ſhe may forget; but I cannot: For, I have Graven thee, on the Palmes of my hands.</hi> And was not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Graven on his heart? Or Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it?</p>
            <p>But yet more, from That he Is. For, <hi>God is Love:</hi> and Vnchangable Love. And <hi>having Loved</hi> himſelf, and <hi>his own</hi> Image; <hi>he Loved it to the End:</hi> and for Ever. And if That Love, could not hold him to <hi>Adam,</hi> in Innocence; It may be hard to know, or believe, his Word can bind him ſo, to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but he may deſert it, in the beſt eſtate, attainable. Seeing it is very hard, to Vnderſtand his Word, or any Verbal Promiſe: or to plead it ſo, with him, as to oblige him by it: If his own heart, do not more, hold him to Good, and Goodneſs, Then All Outward Words, and Promiſes: Or at leaſt, then Any Creature, can do by Them.</p>
            <p>And although Eternal Love, might be Eternal Hatred, unto Sin [which, in the mother Language, ſpeaketh <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> As their <hi>Hate,</hi> is alſo <hi>Sin:]</hi> Yet, That alſo, might be, a Better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why God ſhould Keep him <hi>From Sin;</hi> then why, he ſhould Leave him <hi>In it.</hi> For, by this, it ſeemeth, God is <hi>Love:</hi> and no <hi>Hatred:</hi> only that he <hi>Hateth Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Putting away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love Thinketh no Evil: is not Eaſily Provoked: Suffereth Long: Endureth All, Believeth All, or Hopeth All: Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth All: and doth not only, <hi>Cover a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sins,</hi> but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It ſhall,</hi> or will, <hi>Cover All Tranſgreſſions.</hi> For, it is the <hi>Glory of Man to Paſs by Tranſgreſſions:</hi> And the <hi>Glory of God, to Cover a Matter.</hi> And moſt of all, That which his pure, and <hi>Holy Eyes</hi> cannot endure to ſee.</p>
            <p>And if nothing could preſerve him, <hi>From Sin,</hi> Or excuſe him <hi>In it:</hi> Yet there might be ſomewhat found, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede, for the Sinner: or to diſtinguiſh, between his Sin, and his Perſon. Who at beſt, was but, As a Little, Very Little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, Vnto God. And when a Sinner, yet <hi>His Off-ſpring:</hi> and His Image ſtill: &amp; ſo remained, As a man. And So Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, to <hi>Noah.</hi> Yea, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bids them All ſay, <hi>Our Father.</hi> For, we Are, <hi>His Off-ſpring,</hi> ſtill: and he is <hi>the Father of our Spirits.</hi> Yea, and Man, that before the Fall, was but the <hi>Image of God;</hi> is now [called] <hi>The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not diſpute, or enquire, How Man came to Fall: or God, to Change his State, or Place, before the Fall. Or to abridge him, of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, he ſeemed, to Grant before: When he gave him, <hi>All Trees,</hi> for, his food: But then came, and forbad the <hi>Tree of Knowledge.</hi> Which yet, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may be meant, of ſome other kind of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> then is commonly taken.</p>
            <p>Nor can I determine, What God meant by That, <hi>In Dying thou ſhalt Dye.</hi> Seeing, even Since the Fall alſo, <hi>Job</hi> deſcribeth <hi>Death,</hi> as That, which might be Loved, More then Life. And the Wiſeſt man aſſerts, <hi>the Day of Death, is Better, then of Birth:</hi> and God might ſet the <hi>Cherubins</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> to keep us from That Tree, which would have made us Live for <hi>Ever:</hi> notwithſtanding All, the Threatening of <hi>Death.</hi> Which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, was not ſo certain, but that a Taſt of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> might have Turned it, into <hi>Life Eternal.</hi> But E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it ſelf, may be a Burthen, to One, that is Vnhappy, In his Life, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152720:8"/>
Being. So, that it might be, an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to Dye.</p>
            <p>And the words, Threatning Death to <hi>Adam,</hi> are no worſe, then God uſed to <hi>David,</hi> of his Little Child: or Other Children of God: which ſure, was not <hi>Eternal Death.</hi> And to Good <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi> It was added alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt Dye, and ſhalt not Live:</hi> and yet he did not Dye, but Live.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> God hath ſaid, <hi>When I ſay,</hi> or ſhall ſay, <hi>to a Wicked Man, In Dying thou ſhalt Dye</hi> (the very words Threatened to <hi>Adam:)</hi> yet, if he <hi>Turn,</hi> and Repent: <hi>he ſhall ſurely Live: he ſhall not Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſure, we may hope, God meant no worſe, to Good and Holy <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in Innocence, then he Profeſſeth that he meaneth, To a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> in Wickedneſs. To whom yet, the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is but on <hi>Condition;</hi> and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an Oath, That he taketh <hi>no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death, of a Wicked Man:</hi> and leſs, in the Death of a <hi>Righteous man:</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> was, in Innocence.</p>
            <p>And yet, he let him Fall. To draw out Attributes, which could not well appear, on Holy, Happy Objects. Or, in a word, to <hi>Love him More.</hi> Or draw, delight, and ſelf complacence (which may ſeem a kind of <hi>ſelfiſh Love)</hi> to Better, Higher: that is Lower; yet more Noble, Love; of Pity; and ſuch Tender bowels of compaſſion, as could not be ſhewed, But to <hi>Miſerable Objects. Shut up</hi> under Guilt, <hi>through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief: that ſo he might have Mercy on them:</hi> which can appear, Only in <hi>Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, Eternal Wiſdom, did Contrive, at once to <hi>Propagate it ſelf;</hi> and <hi>Magnifie its Love.</hi> So that it now can Truly Love a Loveleſs Object, with the ſame, or a Better Love then he Loved <hi>Adam,</hi> in Innocence: That I ſay not, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: Who ſaith, a Little Love can love a Friend or One alike; and it may be Leſs to Love One Lovely, Fair and Kind. For, Sinners can do This: and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
            <p>Nor did he, Only <hi>defer his Anger, For his own Names Sake:</hi> But that, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might be, the Great Example, and Pattern, of <hi>All Long-ſuffering and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (which he knew, Great enough, to Conquer <hi>All Evil:)</hi> He would not Let the <hi>Sun go down upon his Wrath.</hi> But on the very ſame Day, in which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Fell, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law:</hi> God brought out, the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> and the Firſt Goſpel Promiſe. whence ſome think, the Same Day, of the Jewiſh year, was both, the Great <hi>Faſt,</hi> for the <hi>Fall;</hi> and the <hi>Feaſt of Atonement,</hi> or Expiation.</p>
            <p>For (as the Wiſe woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> ſummed up the Goſpel) <hi>God is no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of Perſons: But he Still Deviſeth Means,</hi> or Devices, <hi>that his Baniſhed</hi> (or thoſe, that might be ſo) <hi>do not Periſh From him;</hi> who ſtill <hi>Hateth Putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he Then, Deviſed, ſuch a Way, as Far ſurpaſſeth all our thoughts: and Then our Words, are like to <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Counſel, without Knowledge.</hi> Yet, there is a Spirit, that can make us <hi>know, the things, which are Freely Given us of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Poets have a Tradition, that when the Gyants Roſe, and Fought, againſt Heaven; They could not be Conquered, but by the help, of ſome <hi>Mortal Man:</hi> and ſo, the Gods, asked avd of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Who ſlew one of the Greateſt Gyants; but he ſoon revived again; and waxed Stronger then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Till <hi>Minerva</hi> Caught him, and threw him out of the Moon; and ſo he dyed.</p>
            <p>This (and that they have, of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra;</hi> and of <hi>Python;</hi> and the Serpent, ſlain by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> or others) may be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152720:8"/>
grounded on the Firſt <hi>Goſpel Promiſe,</hi> Vpon the fall. <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall Break the Serpents Head.</hi> And yet, not by its own Strength, or Wiſdom; but aſſiſted by the Spirit of God: and in Vnion, with Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>And yet ſtill, it is, <hi>The Seed of the Woman.</hi> God having choſen, the <hi>Weakeſt</hi> Sex, to overcome his <hi>Strongeſt</hi> Enemies: and the moſt <hi>Fooliſh,</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Wiſdome of the Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Subtili Serpent.</hi> Who did Firſt, aſſail the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as the <hi>Weaker Veſſel:)</hi> and is Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, by the <hi>Womans Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though, in All this work, we owe, very much, to the Love of the <hi>Son of God</hi> (who Loved <hi>Our Nature, and built us a Synagogue:</hi> &amp; was the <hi>Bleſſed Seed of the Woman.)</hi> Yet, the <hi>Root of the Matter,</hi> is the Love of the <hi>Father.</hi> And of His Perſon, it is ſaid in ſpecial, <hi>God is Love.</hi> Even <hi>God the Father:</hi> and hath ſhewed That Love, in <hi>ſending his Son:</hi> and the Sons Great Work, is ſtill to expreſs the <hi>Love of the Father,</hi> who ſent him. <hi>And God ſo Loved the World, that He Gave His Only Son: and none can come To the Son, but whom the Father Draweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although, All the Saints, in All the Bible, uſe to addreſs themſelves, very much, to the <hi>Son,</hi> in their Vſual Convers and Prayers (As the <hi>45th.</hi> and 102<hi>d. Pſal.</hi> is Cited in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and ſo the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and All the <hi>Vials of Odors,</hi> or <hi>Praiers of Saints,</hi> were <hi>To the Lamb:)</hi> yet in This, the Apoſtle doth eſpecially, bow <hi>To the Father;</hi> that He would Vouchſafe, to ſhew them <hi>the Love of his Son: Paſſing Knowledge: That they might be filled, with All the Fulneſſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although, it be a Great Work of the Goſpel, to perſwade us that Chriſt was the <hi>Son of God:</hi> (and a Great Man Thought All our Shakings came, From not being Rooted in This) yet, there is alſo a very Great ſtreſs in This, That he is, <hi>The Son of Man:</hi> and The <hi>Promiſed Seed of the Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame Ap. that of All things, bids his Son, <hi>Remember This, that Chriſt of the Seed of David, was raiſed up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Goſpel:</hi> In another place, hath ſummed up All, in This.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the fulneſs, of the Time, was come, God ſent Forth His Son, made of a Woman, made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law: that We might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> And ſo the Son of God is ſent, To make the <hi>Sons of Men</hi> become <hi>the Sons of God.</hi> But for this alſo, it <hi>Became him,</hi> and was requiſite and Neceſſary, that he ſhould be alſo the <hi>Son of Man:</hi> and <hi>Seed of the Woman. Made of a Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was the Beſt, and only Way, To Bring in, <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs:</hi> To Satisfie God; and to Sanctifie Man.</p>
            <p>For, by This Vnion, of Natures (and All things conſequent) He comes, to be Charged, with <hi>Our Sins:</hi> and we, with <hi>His Righteouſneſs:</hi> being made, <hi>Partakers of His Divine Nature:</hi> as He, of <hi>Our Humane.</hi> And Then, As Our Acts, are Imputed unto Him: So are His, to Vs: having the ſame Spirit, by which, He did them. Elſe, they be not Ours.</p>
            <p>For, if God had come, and Acted in us, as an Angel, or a Dove: Thoſe Acts, In us, had not been <hi>Ours:</hi> Except, their Principle, were made <hi>One,</hi> with Vs; and We, <hi>One</hi> with Him.</p>
            <p>For which, God hath ſo Vnited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto Chriſt; that He is become the <hi>Head of the Body.</hi> And His Vnion, to our Natures, is the Root of Ours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His Spirit. And Till This, be wrought In us; we do not Act, but are Acted; by Some Other: Not, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, of Life and Motion.</p>
            <p>This being the Great thing, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Prayed For (in All, that ſhould believe on him) that they <hi>All, might</hi> come to be <hi>One in Him;</hi> and <hi>Perfect in</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152720:9"/>
               <hi>One.</hi> And Not only, they <hi>In Him,</hi> but He <hi>In them:</hi> and <hi>abide in Them</hi> (as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Chap.) And ſo, he concludeth, his Solemn Prayer, With Repeating That particular (ſo much inſiſted on before:) <hi>And I In them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, we are, not only, <hi>His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters;</hi> But (as Himſelf ſaid) <hi>His Mother alſo.</hi> When, He is <hi>Made Known,</hi> and <hi>Formed In us. Chriſt In you</hi> the <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi> But I muſt onely Glance at This, which is ſo Fully trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, elſewhere.</p>
            <p>And as God, hath pleaſed to <hi>Manifeſt</hi> himſelf, In Our Nature, ſo he hath alſo <hi>Filled</hi> it, with That, which is <hi>Infinite;</hi> ſo, that it cannot hold it in: but is even Forced to Vent it: and Longeth, to be Drawn, and Sucked, more then ever Anv, Womans Breſt.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am full of the Spirit of God, and I muſt utter it.</hi> And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>O How am Iſtraitned, Till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed!</hi> As a ſweet Perfume, or Oyntment, in ones hand; the more, it be Preſſed, the more it Floweth out. And when the Breſt is Full, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls for Any Child: the Son of a Stranger: If her Own, be not Ready to Suck.</p>
            <p>And This Great Advantage, we have Gotten, by Gods putting His<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Own, <hi>Infinite</hi> Nature, into Our <hi>Finite:</hi> That it muſt flow Out, to Eaſe its ſelf (as we may ſpeak.) Being ſo Vaſtly Great, beyond the Humane Nature, that it cannot be contained in it: but As the Great Ocean, in a Little Shell. Still Flowing Vp, and Flowing Out. Whereas, If he had ſent the <hi>Son,</hi> only as God: or <hi>the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> They might have ſo Contained, or Detained, the Godhead: that we might, have ſeen it, no more, then in the very <hi>Father.</hi> But now, <hi>God is Manifeſt in Fleſh;</hi> which can not hold, What it hath, Too Great, for the narrow cover.</p>
            <p>We may add alſo, that our Saviour himſelf ſaid, <hi>It is a more Bleſſed thing to Give, then to Receive.</hi> So that Himſelf, was not <hi>So Bleſſed,</hi> by <hi>Receiving, All the fulneſs of the Godhead:</hi> As he was, and ſtill is, by <hi>Giving</hi> it Out. And If we <hi>knew the Gift of God;</hi> and Happineſs to Give<hi>:</hi> And <hi>Who it was,</hi> that ſaid it To us: <hi>We would aske, and He would Give us, a Fountain of Living Water;</hi> flowing out to God and Men about us. For <hi>In our Fathers Houſe is Bread Enough, and to Spare:</hi> and in our <hi>Brothers Heart,</hi> enough to ſpare: of <hi>Water, Wine, and Milk:</hi> ſtill Running out; and crying, <hi>Come, Every One, that thirſteth: Come:</hi> yea <hi>Come and Drink:</hi> and Drink <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datly, My Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Good will of Him that dwelt in the Buſh:</hi> That ever Flamed, but was not Conſumed. For, by this Vnion, in our Saviour; the Divine <hi>Fire,</hi> is cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, in Humane <hi>Water</hi> (the <hi>Piller in the Cloud:)</hi> that it is both Safe, and Suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and Pleaſing to us. Whereas elſe, it had devoured us. For, <hi>Our God, is a Conſuming Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when All the People ſaw it, They ran away and cryed, O Let not God ſpeak thus any more; but let Him ſpeak by Thee; and We will hear.</hi> And then he anſwered, <hi>They have Rightly Spoken.</hi> This was my Intent, in All my Thundering; but to make them ſee their Need; of ſuch a <hi>Mediator.</hi> And now Therefore, <hi>I will Raiſe up a Prophet, From among their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Like unto Thee.</hi> And this, is 4 times repeated in <hi>Deut.</hi> with the 3. and 7. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And in every place, it is ſtill obſerved, that the Prophet, muſt be a <hi>Brother. From among thy Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Scripture puts a Mighty ſtreſs on This, that in All his Offices, our Saviour is, and ſo was made, <hi>Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And the Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> is bold to ſay, that <hi>In All things;</hi> even All
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152720:9"/>
things. <hi>It behoved Him</hi> (for Our and His advantage alſo) <hi>to be made like His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> And although it was ſo in <hi>All things:</hi> yet in ſpecial, that, He might be a <hi>Merciful and Faithful, High Prieſt.</hi> For, Every High Prieſt is Ordained <hi>For Men,</hi> and Taken <hi>From among Them. For them:</hi> Not Againſt them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Holy Brethren, partakers of that Heavenly Calling of a <hi>Brother:</hi> Look upon, and much <hi>Conſider,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (prophet) and High Prieſt; we ſo <hi>Profeſs,</hi> or Own, and Claim to be our <hi>Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Let us hold faſt this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> or this Claim of Chriſt, in ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> For, <hi>we have not an High Prieſt,</hi> that cannot be touched with our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: or Feeling of them: but was in <hi>All Points, Tempted as We are.</hi> Even in All points! (both of Subſtance, and Circumſtance alſo.) To Preſume, and to Deſpair: yea, and to deſtroy Himſelf: and other horrid Temptations.</p>
            <p>Let us Therefore (even <hi>Therefore)</hi> Come with Boldneſs; to the Throne of Grace: that ſo, we may obtain mercy; and <hi>find Grace,</hi> to Help in a <hi>time of Need.</hi> For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A Brother was born for a Time of Need:</hi> or For a <hi>Day of Adverſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the very ſigh, by which we expreſs ſorrow (in all Languages) <hi>Ah, Ah;</hi> is alſo, <hi>Brother, Brother,</hi> in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language. As if God would teach us, ſtill in ſorrow, both to think of a <hi>Brother;</hi> and Call for his Help. To which, himſelf may allude, in that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy: They ſhall not Lament,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ah Brother,</hi> or <hi>Ah Siſter.</hi> And we never cry <hi>Ah; Ah;</hi> but our Saviour hears, and knows, we need Him: crying: <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he knoweth alſo, and hath told us, <hi>There is No Temptation on us, but was common</hi> to our Nature: and to Him, as made in it. And <hi>He is Faithful, and will not ſuffer us to be Tempted, Above our Strength;</hi> or His, in us: As <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to Every one that <hi>Calls on the Name of Chriſt, Their Lord and Ours:</hi> and yet, our <hi>Brother</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>This was it, the Spouſe longed for, <hi>O that thou wert my Brother; that ſucked the breſts of my Mother! when I found Thee, I would Kiſs Thee; and I ſhould not be deſpiſed. I would lead thee to my Mothers Houſe</hi> (as <hi>Iſaac</hi> led <hi>Rebecca,</hi> into <hi>Sarahs Tent:)</hi> and I <hi>would give Thee Spiced Wine, and Pomgranates</hi> (as of mixed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:) <hi>And his left hand ſhould be under my head; and his Right hand ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me.</hi> Not afraid of either Hand: it ſeems.</p>
            <p>And He is now, ſo made <hi>Our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> As ſhe longed. And we may preſs it on him. If He be Indeed, <hi>That Prophet,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Then he is, <hi>our Brother.</hi> Elſe we may not Take him, for our <hi>Prophet,</hi> or our <hi>King.</hi> For God expreſly tells his people, <hi>If at any time, they Chooſe a King, They may not Take a Stranger:</hi> But a Brother. <hi>One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy Brethren.</hi> and repeats it, yet again, and adds. <hi>Thou mayeſt not ſet a Stranger over thee; Who is not thy Brother.</hi> And again, When he is <hi>ſet Over thee, he ſhall take heed, he do not exalt himſelf above his Brethren:</hi> but muſt ſtill own himſelf to be Their <hi>Brother:</hi> that he may <hi>prolong his Reign Over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were to read that Scripture in a Solemn Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at <hi>Releaſes.</hi> And when King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> came to Read it ſo: He wept, Vntill they cryed, that he was their <hi>Brother:</hi> and the Law did own him ſo.</p>
            <p>And ſo is Chriſt. That we may go to our Saviour, As They came to <hi>Joſeph:</hi> And as the words are, <hi>They gave him a Charge</hi> (in the Name of their Father) ſaying, <hi>Our Father, bid us ſay, Forgive, I pray thee now, the Treſtaſs of thy Brethren:</hi> and when <hi>Joſeph</hi> heard them ſpeak, <hi>He</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152720:10"/>
               <hi>wept:</hi> and ſo, he did, when firſt he made them know, he was their <hi>Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thus, <hi>Ruth,</hi> was ſent, by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy,</hi> to <hi>Boaz</hi> (one of <hi>Might:</hi> a Type of Chriſt: the next a kin to <hi>Ebimeleck; My God the King:)</hi> and bid to lye down at his feet; and ſaid, <hi>Spread thy skirt over thine Handmaid:</hi> For, <hi>thou art a near Kinſman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Law, hath put a ſpecial blot on him; that will not Own his <hi>Kindred:</hi> or do the <hi>Office of a Brother;</hi> when he is Required: For the Woman was to <hi>pull off his Shoe, and ſpit in his face:</hi> and thus it <hi>ſhall be done.</hi> And may we not come and tell our Saviour, that his <hi>Brother Adam,</hi> Dyed <hi>without Iſſue to God:</hi> and that He only, can Raiſe it up In Vs: who are now Widows?</p>
            <p>And That it is, not only, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but Commanded, and our Duty, Thus to plead with Chriſt; in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him; may be Farther Cleared from <hi>Solomon.</hi> Not only, Bidding us, <hi>Say to Wiſdom, Thou art my Siſter, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Thou art my near Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> But alſo, to <hi>keep This Law,</hi> as the choyſeſt of All Lawes: <hi>and As the Apple of our Eye:</hi> the tendereſt part of all the body. And he plainly ſhews us, This is the way, to be kept, from the Spirit of Error, and Deluſion, (His <hi>Deceitful Woman:)</hi> Thus, to come to Chriſt, and plead our <hi>Kindred,</hi> and Relation to him. For it is He only, that is True <hi>Wiſdom. In whom are hid All Treaſures of Wiſdom, and Knowledge. The Power and Wiſdom of God:</hi> and ſo deſcribed, by <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo in divers places. As, in his 8. Chap. Where <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſhews its pedigree; and <hi>Coming forth from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, There alſo, This Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, profeſſeth, that although He were <hi>With God;</hi> and <hi>brought up with him; and Daily His Delight; Rejoycing alwayes before him;</hi> Yet I <hi>rejoyced in the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of his Earth;</hi> and <hi>my Delight was with the Sons of Men.</hi> And not onely with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence: but even Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Fall:</hi> Till which, we find no <hi>Sons of Men.</hi> But my Delight was with the <hi>Sons of Men. Now</hi> Therefore, <hi>Hearken to me O ye Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where he maketh <hi>His Delight in the Sons of Men,</hi> the Ground of his Call: and we ſtill run away, From all his Calls, till we believe, They Spring, from <hi>His Delight</hi> In us: or at leaſt, ſome Love To Vs.</p>
            <p>As we may ſee in the Very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Law. Which is All found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on This, <hi>I am the Lord Thy God,</hi> and <hi>Thy Redeemer.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Thou ſhalt have No Other Gods: or Wayes of Worſhip: but ſhalt Love my Name, and keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</hi> Becauſe <hi>I am Thy God,</hi> and have <hi>Loved thee.</hi> which we may find the firſt and laſt of All, or moſt Commands in all the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God ſaw it ſtrange, or vain, to aske Our <hi>Hearts:</hi> or ſuch Reſpect, and Reverence, as became a God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave us <hi>His Heart:</hi> and Owned himſelf to be <hi>Our God:</hi> and to Love us <hi>Heartily.</hi> For <hi>Who hath firſt Given? or hath Lent to him? that it might be paid, or recompenſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I diſpute not here, To Whom, the Law was Given: (though we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, that tells us, it was Given, to the <hi>Worſt of Sinners.</hi> And how Elſe, are They Guilty, of Breaking it? If it were not, Given to them?) But for the preſent, Let it be granted only, that it was Given unto Chriſt; as a Man; and the <hi>Seed of Abraham alſo:</hi> (that was put <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law,</hi> more, it may be, then <hi>Adam</hi> was:) and <hi>Circumciſed alſo,</hi> for a <hi>Debtor to the Whole Law:</hi> and <hi>To Fulfill All Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he was not only, <hi>Put,</hi> under the Law (as other men were) but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152720:10"/>
               <hi>Made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder it;</hi> For his very Being, was, made up, of the Holy, Righteous Image of God: which was, but ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ewed, in the Law. Which was ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in his Heart, alſo, that he could, as ſoon, Vnmake himſelf, and let out All his Being; as ever break, one Tittle, of the Law. Which was, his Pleaſure alſo; and his choice delight: and not a Burthen, As to Vs. Nor can wee conceive him, an Holy, Good Man: In Perfect Wiſdom, and Integrity; But, he muſt be Made Of, With, and Vnder the <hi>Moral Law of God:</hi> as Near, and Dear, to him, as his own Life and Being.</p>
            <p>So, that He, cannot plead, his own Death, to Free him From it: As we may, to Free our ſelves, from the Law; which hath <hi>Power over us, But While we Live. For, He that is Dead, is Freed from Sin,</hi> (a Bleſſed Word:) <hi>and From the Law alſo.</hi> But He was, ſo <hi>Made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder it;</hi> that he choſe, to Live <hi>again, to Keep it more;</hi> as his own Choiſeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And Himſelf, hath ſummed up, All the Law, into <hi>Love.</hi> And of his <hi>Love to God,</hi> his Father, we nothing doubt: but of his <hi>Love to Man,</hi> is All the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Yet we read, It is Vain, for a Man, to ſpeak of <hi>Loving God:</hi> If he do not alſo <hi>Love his Neighbour.</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made, <hi>As Great a Law,</hi> as That of <hi>Loving God;</hi> and Like, or <hi>Equall unto,</hi> That, he made, the <hi>Firſt, and Great Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he may ſeem, to make it More: (or of More Worth, and acceptance, which God) to <hi>Love Ones Neighbour,</hi> then, any otherwiſe, to <hi>Love God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> For, That of Loving on's Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and <hi>Doing to All,</hi> As one would wiſh to <hi>himſelf;</hi> he ſaith Is <hi>The Law, and the Prophets</hi> alſo: Which is more, then we read, of <hi>All Other Love to God.</hi> And the Law and the Prophets alſo do More forbid, <hi>Evil Thoughts ond Words, againſt, a Brother or Neighbour,</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, God himſelf, As <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. <hi>Zechar.</hi> 7. 10. 8. 17.</p>
            <p>And Man, hath nothing elſe, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, to Expreſs, his love to God, (whom he cannot ſee, or reach, by All his Righteouſneſs and Love:) but by <hi>Loving his Neighbour:</hi> That is <hi>Every Man.</hi> For, he that <hi>Loved Another, hath Fulfilled the Whole Law.</hi> And All elſe is but a Tinckling Cymbal.</p>
            <p>For, even That, which bids me Love God, and his Name, with All my Soul, and Might; requires me both, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Name, and Nature, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: and to Preſerve it, and Reſtore it, All I may. And is not This, to <hi>Love my Neighbour, As my ſelf,</hi> or More?</p>
            <p>For, Is there a Man, in the World, in whom, I may not ſee the Name, and Image, and Glory, of God; as much, or more, then yet it is, in me? Or ſoon, it may be ſo: and that it may; I muſt, and cannot but endeavour, All I can; If I Love God, with <hi>All my Soul and Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I ſee, the Saints of God, ſtill Meaſure All their Love to God, by <hi>Declaring his Name to Men;</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known, his <hi>Lovelineſs.</hi> As the Spouſe did, Till even <hi>They that ſinote her, and took away her Veyle,</hi> (or at leaſt, knew him not, whom her <hi>Soul</hi> loved) Came, <hi>and ſought him, with her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And another Cryed, <hi>Let him not ſpare; For, I have not hidden his Holy Word: But I have, and will Declare it, to my Brethren:</hi> Yea, to the <hi>Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Loe, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knoweſt.</hi> I have not hid thy Righteouſneſs, within my Heart. I have declared Thy faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Thy Salvation, I have not Concealed thy Loving kidneſs, and thy Truth: <hi>from the Great Congregation.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152720:11"/>
And I <hi>will Declare,</hi> Thy Name, <hi>to All Congregations;</hi> and <hi>to All Generations:</hi> and <hi>I will Declare for Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was, with <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; for, it was He, that Spake, and Acted In Thoſe Holy Men: and moſt of All, in thoſe peculiar Pſalms of <hi>Chriſt, upon the Croſs.</hi> And his dying Prayer, ſaith, <hi>I have Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thy Name:</hi> I have finiſhed My Work: For, <hi>I have Declared Thy Name:</hi> and have made it <hi>Manifeſt.</hi> And yet again, <hi>I have done it, and I will do it.</hi> For, it is ſo ſweet, that I cannot forbear: and the more I ſpread it, the more I ſee its beauty, and its ſweetneſs: and the more I Rub, This Precious Oyntment, It Perfumeth more. <hi>Thy Name, is an Oyntment Poured forth;</hi> and <hi>Therefore the Virgins love Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if We look, on All, the Laws of God, through All the <hi>Bible,</hi> we ſhall find Them More, <hi>For Man,</hi> and His Good; then <hi>For God,</hi> and His Gain, or Glory; but in <hi>Mans Happineſs.</hi> And All, Eſtabliſhed, <hi>In,</hi> and <hi>Through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Great <hi>Law Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> as God: and the Great <hi>Law Keeper,</hi> as Man: both to God, and Men alſo.</p>
            <p>The Jews tell us, that before the World was made, God bowed down, and put his hand, under his Robe of Glory; and brought out the <hi>Spirit of the Meſſiah</hi> (which they ſay, Firſt <hi>Moved on the Waters:)</hi> and looking on it, ſaid, <hi>Wilt thou Redeem Iſrael?</hi> and when, he anſwered, <hi>Yea:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>But Doſt thou well to conſider, All the Toyle, of That Great Work? Art thou indeed content, to lay aſide thy Robes, and Kiſs their Raggs? To Suck their Wounds, and Waſh their Sores, and wipe away their Putrid fleſh? To be among the Chains, and Tombes; and rowle away their Clots, and Worms? To Love their Duſt! and raiſe them from the Grave of Death, and Rottenneſs?</hi> and when, upon ſome pauſe, he <hi>Said, he would: and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Glad, to do it All:</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kiſt him; and made, an Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant, with him: or to That Effect.</p>
            <p>Which is but ſome, of This, before us, <hi>Made of a Woman: and made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law.</hi> Even, All the <hi>Law of Love,</hi> To Man, as Well as to God: and to <hi>Redeem Them, that were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law; that ſo we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is Somewhat, in All the Laws, and Promiſes, that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, relate to Chriſt: and is laid, upon Him, by God; and expected from him.</p>
            <p>As the Firſt, and Fundamental Promiſe (that <hi>the Womans Seed ſhall Break the Serpents head:)</hi> Is Promiſed, to Man; but Required of Chriſt. For, it is not ſaid, <hi>It May,</hi> but it <hi>Muſt:</hi> and <hi>Shall, Break the Serpent.</hi> Or, as the 72 <hi>Pſal</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>He ſhall break in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Oppreſſor:</hi> and as other Scriptures have it, <hi>He ſhall Looſe his knots</hi> (as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Curling; <hi>Croſſing Serpent,</hi> in <hi>Iſaia</hi> 27.) <hi>he ſhall diſſolve All the Works of the Devil.</hi> Yea, and <hi>by Death, deſtroy him, that hath the Power of Death, which is the Devil;</hi> and ſhall <hi>Root up Every Plant, the Heavenly Father hath not Planted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if <hi>Sin,</hi> come Vnder, Theſe Plants; or Thoſe Promiſes: may we not hope, it ſhall be <hi>Rooted out,</hi> and quite deſtroyed? As the Church is bid to Cry, <hi>Take away All Iniquity</hi> (Not onely <hi>Ours,</hi> but <hi>All.)</hi> and Let the <hi>Iniquity of the Wicked come to an end.</hi> As it is Prayed; and Therfore Promiſed; in the Pſalms: and we are bid to cry for All; <hi>Forgive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s our Sins.</hi> Yea, and Chriſt, Prayeth This, <hi>In us</hi> and with us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be Granted: for He ſayeth, <hi>Lord Forgive: As I,</hi> and <hi>Theſe,</hi> and <hi>All my Children Do forgive.</hi>

            <p>And the Beauty, of That Image To be <hi>Formed in them,</hi> will ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, All the Labour of Chriſt; that He will Never, Repent it.

            </p>
            <p>And the Sabbatical year of Reſt, was For the Earth alſo; <hi>the Earth which the Lord Curſed.</hi> Nor might they reap, What grew of its Self. <hi>For, it is a year of Reſt, unto the Land: and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Land,</hi> ſhall be meat, for Thee, and thy Maid, and Hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and for the Stranger that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journeth with thee: and the <hi>Gleaning,</hi> of every Harveſt, muſt be left for the <hi>Poor and Stranger.</hi> As the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Levit.</hi> Where we have alſo the Sum of All the Royal Law of Love: As it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on Every Man, as Man: and ſo, on Chriſt Alſo.</p>

            <p>And Thus, he promiſed, the <hi>Holy Spirit, to Reprove the World.</hi> And we ſhould beg it much. As <hi>David</hi> Cryes, <hi>O Search and Try me, If any Evil way be in Me: and Lead me in the Way Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> All other wayes, will quickly end: <hi>As Thorns in a fire.</hi>

               <hi>Thouſhalt not Avenge; or Bear any grudge, againſt the Children of thy People: But thouſhalt Love thy Neighbour, As thy Self. I am the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A Great Argument for Mercy. <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me: Forſake not the Work of thy Own Hands.</hi> And, <hi>Haſt Thou not poured me out as Milk?

            <p>
               <hi>O Thou Preſerver of Men! What ſhall I do to thee? I have Sinned; but why Wilt thou not Pardon my Tranſgreſſions; and Take away mine Iniquities? Wilt thou not ſeek me in the morning?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all theſe may comment, on That Law of Love, in <hi>Leviticus. Thou ſhalt not avenge, or Retain, againſt the Children of thy People. But Thou ſhalt Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> As plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewing that Any <hi>Retaining Anger,</hi> is not conſiſtent, with the Good Law of God, or Love of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>And leſt we ſhould miſtake, the Phraſe of <hi>Neighbour, and Brother,</hi> uſed here; the very ſame Chapter, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to love a <hi>Stranger, As ones ſelf.</hi> the 19. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 34. and the 25. doth alſo make a <hi>ſtranger as a Brother.</hi> Saving If Thy <hi>Brother wax poor,</hi> thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him: though a <hi>Stranger or a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer.</hi> And to other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for <hi>Strangers:</hi> (as that, They were <hi>Strangers, in Egypt;</hi> and muſt know the <hi>Heart of a Stranger:)</hi> It is added alſo, that <hi>God Loveth Strangers.</hi> And the Hebrews are bidden, not to <hi>Forget to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Strangers;</hi> becauſe ſome have ſo, <hi>Entertained Angels unawares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, One of the hardeſt words of our Saviour is, <hi>I know you not;</hi> or, you are <hi>Strangers.</hi> Though himſelf obſerveth the <hi>Law of ſtrangers,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I was a ſtranger, and you took Me not in</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Stranger did not Lodge without</hi> his Doors:) And in the Good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the phraſe of <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or <hi>Brother,</hi> is plainly made, to reach a <hi>Stranger, and an Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, in the Law alſo. For What, in one place, is a <hi>Brothers Ox</hi> or <hi>Aſſe,</hi> In another, is an <hi>Enemies, and His that Hateth us:</hi> and yet, His <hi>Laden, ſtraying Aſſe,</hi> muſt be Pitied, and Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Wilt thou Ceaſe to Help him?</hi> Or to leave thy Buſineſs for him? (as the Margent of our Bible:) <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely Leave it, to joyn with him,</hi> and help him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 15.</p>
            <p>And although our Souls, be as the <hi>Wild Aſſes Colts;</hi> yet we may plead This Law alſo, with our Saviour. Though they be the <hi>Aſſes, of his Enemies, and them that Hate him;</hi> Yet in ſtraying, or being Laden; He will keep This Law: and <hi>ſurely Joyn to Help them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to This, he might allude, when he ſent his Diſciples, to looſe the <hi>Aſſe (Tyed in the Broad way, where</hi> 2 <hi>wayes met)</hi> and then came, <hi>Meek and Lowly;</hi> As the King of <hi>Zion, upon an Aſſe, the Foal of an Aſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the paralel place in <hi>Deut.</hi> ſpeaking, of a <hi>Brothers,</hi> or a <hi>Strangers, Ox</hi> or <hi>Aſſe,</hi> by That Occaſion, giveth a General Rule, of All things that <hi>are Loſt.</hi> In <hi>like manner ſhalt thou do, with his Aſſe, and ſo ſhalt thou do with his Rayment; and with All Loſt things.

Whom the Lord ſhall Bleſs,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be Aegypt my People. Which was gotten by ſome Cruel Lord, Oppreſſing them. For, the Lord ſhall ſmite, and he will Heal.</hi> As <hi>Eſay</hi> 19. And though Chriſt, be alſo a <hi>King,</hi> yet even ſo, alſo, He was Vnder the Law: and Made Vnder it. For the great <hi>Law of the King,</hi> was This, that even, <hi>when he ſat upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he ſhould write out the Law; and read it, All his dayes:</hi> that ſo he might be ſure to keep it: <hi>and not exalt himſelf above his Brethren: but Prolong his Kingom in the Midſt,</hi> or heart <hi>of his Subjects.</hi> And it is, a Great Character, of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to think himſelf <hi>Above the Law:</hi> or to attempt to <hi>Change the Times and Laws:</hi> As in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. and if God, have put, All men, below Coertion of the Law, Then who can Exempt them? or ſet them Above it? And perhaps, there is nothing more Dangerous, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man, then to preſume, or to pretend himſelf, to be <hi>Above the Law:</hi> which God hath ſet a bound to Kings (it may be) Rather then to Private Men; whom others ſtill will bound enough, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And the Great Law of a King, is <hi>Mercy</hi> Rather then Any thing elſe. For ſo, Solomon ſaith, <hi>Mercy, and Truth preſerve a King; but his Throne is Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Mercy.</hi> By Mercy, rather, then Any thing elſe: or before All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: As the words plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. <hi>And ſhall a Man Dye This Day? Am I not King of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we may preſs it much, on Chriſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152720:14"/>
as the Great Law, of a wiſe King; to <hi>Preſerve his Throne by Mercy:</hi> that it do not Totter. For, of Him, and His Throne, it is eſpecially ſaid, <hi>In Mercy ſhall the Throne be Eſtabliſhed:</hi> As <hi>Eſay</hi> 16. In alluſion to That of Solomon, <hi>The Throne is Eſtabliſhed by Mercy.</hi> And the Pſalms ſay, His Throne is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, becauſe <hi>Mercy and Truth are Ever before it,</hi> and above it: and he fings of <hi>Mercy,</hi> with his Greateſt <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> and <hi>Happy are They, that Hear, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, That Joyful Sound. For, In Thy Righteouſneſs</hi> (Thy very Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) <hi>they ſhall be exalted, All the day long,</hi> or, (as another Pſalm) <hi>They ſhall rejoyce in All thy Righteous Judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, If his tender <hi>Mercy, be above All his Works,</hi> Then ſure, <hi>Above his Judgements alſo:</hi> which he calls his <hi>Strange Acts.</hi> But <hi>Mercy,</hi> is his own Child. For, he is the <hi>Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> which are therefore <hi>One with Chriſt his Only Son.</hi> and yet, a little while, and <hi>Mercy ſhall Triumph againſt,</hi> or Over, <hi>Judgement:</hi> as we read in <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Chriſt alſo, bids them, <hi>Go, and learn That; I will have Mercy, rather then Any Sacrifice.</hi> And to him, it was ſpoken, <hi>Ride on Proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth and Meekneſs of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And He hath ſhewed thee <hi>O man! what is Good, and what the Lord Delighteth in: To do Juſtice;</hi> but in that Alſo, <hi>To Love Mercy.</hi> Or as <hi>Jeremy</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>To Exerciſe Loving Kindneſs and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For, in Theſe I delight.</hi> And in the next Chapter, the Prophet prayeth For Gods <hi>Correction</hi> (O the bleſſed <hi>Rods of the Covenant!)</hi> and <hi>with Judgement</hi> alſo; but with ſuch <hi>Judgement,</hi> as the Chapter before: <hi>ſtill tempered with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> And <hi>Solomons</hi> Son loſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the 10 Tribes, by not obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fathers Good Rule, of <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his Throne, by Mercy;</hi> neglecting the Wiſe Councel, of the Old Men, that told him his Way, to get, and keep, the hearts of his Subjects, was to be <hi>more Merciful, then his Father.</hi> Which we may Preſſe on Chriſt; as the wiſeſt Councel; that he get, and keep his Subjects Hearts, by being <hi>More Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, then his Father</hi> yet hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf. And yet our Saviour gives it, As a ſufficient Reaſon, why the <hi>Father</hi> alſo ſhould grant All that is asked of him: becauſe he is a Great and Glorious King. And ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth All his Prayer, with no other, <hi>For</hi> but This: <hi>For, thine is the Kingdom, Power and Glory.</hi> As if This alone, were Cauſe enough, why he ſhould do, All that is Asked. And when <hi>Solomons</hi> Mother deſcribeth, <hi>the Law of Kindneſs, in the Good Womans Tongue;</hi> She gives her Son, This <hi>Law of Kindneſs, for his Heart. Open thy mouth for the Dumb, in the Caſe of All appointed to Deſtruction.</hi> And again, <hi>Open Thy Mouth: Judge Righteouſly: and Plead the Cauſe of the Poor and Needy.</hi> So that while the King, ſits upon the Throne, As Judge: His own Heart, and Bowels, muſt be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates to Plead, for All the Priſoners, at the bar.</hi> Yea, for All that be <hi>Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Death:</hi> Even for the worſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: who may not have Councel, in ſome Caſes and Places: becauſe indeed the <hi>Judges</hi> are to be their <hi>Counſel,</hi> in All they can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that was <hi>Lemuels</hi> Councel to her Son; and the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> ſhe taught him, as for a Great King to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Laſt of <hi>Proverbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Solomon gives it, to his Son alſo; <hi>If thou forbear, to deliver them that are Drawn unto Death; and Thoſe that are ready to be Slain: If thou ſayeſt, behold we know it not: Doth not He, that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that When, we want an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or know not How, to offer it; we Ought, to go to Chriſt; and tell him, <hi>It is Now His Part, to Give the Sacrifice, and to Prepare it;</hi> that it May be Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered.

and Then, the Prieſt muſt <hi>prepare a Sin-Offering; For All the People of the Land;</hi> or of the <hi>Earth:</hi> it is the ſame word.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> may allude to This alſo; when it ſaith, of Chriſt, <hi>It behoveth him, to be made like his Brethren in All things; that he Might be a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Faithful High Prieſt; To make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People</hi> (as in Ezech. <hi>So ye ſhall Reconcile the Houſe:)</hi> and in the ſame Chapter: <hi>That by the Grace of God he might Taſt Death for Every Man.</hi> Or, as the Angel, Unto Daniel. <hi>To finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin: to make Reconciliation for Iniquity: and to bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi> Thoſe commands, are alſo, given, to <hi>Ezekiel: The Son of Man,</hi> whom God made a <hi>Watchman Over Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> A Mighty Type of Chriſt: <hi>in Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sins of the People:</hi> as God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to him, in his 40 and 390 Dayes.</p>
            <p>And as That he ſpeaketh, of a <hi>Watcher</hi> or Biſhop (as the Phraſe, in all Greek Authors is,) may teach us, To allow <hi>Humane Orders,</hi> to be <hi>Divine Ordinances,</hi> in ſuch Caſes: as the Apoſtles alſo ſpeak: So it may alſo ſhew us the Duty of a <hi>Watcher;</hi> and his Danger, if he neglect his Duty, Towards Any Man. <hi>And who is ſufficient for it?</hi> But only Jeſus Chriſt? Thus Typed, in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> both a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Seer,</hi> and <hi>Watcher.</hi> And thus at once, we have the Law, or Duty both of <hi>Prince and Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> alſo.

            <p>
               <hi>Behold my Servant, whom I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen:</hi> my Beloved, in whom my ſoul is well pleaſed.

            </p>
            <p>And his own Law, for <hi>Servants</hi> is, that they give <hi>All Diligence,</hi> and do <hi>All Heartily.</hi> And Himſelf Maketh it, the Great work of the Chiefeſt Servant, to <hi>Give Others Food, in Due Seaſon:</hi> and with <hi>Meekneſſe.</hi> For, if He do but <hi>begin to ſmite his Fellow Servants,</hi> (yet he is to Rule them) but if once, he do <hi>begin, to ſmite:)</hi> his Lord will <hi>come and cut him aſunder.</hi>

               <hi>In Patience Poſſeſs your Souls,</hi> which Elſe you loſe: Or at leaſt your <hi>Crown.

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> could not find a better Pattern, or a better Argument, then to beſeech us, <hi>by the Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs of Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p>And the Jews deliver it, as one of the Firſt Traditions of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Elders, and ſo downwards; that they ſhould make Diſciples of the Law, by <hi>Meekneſs: being ſlow to ſpeak</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> was) <hi>and ſlower to Wrath, or Judging.</hi> which we find alſo, in <hi>Ieams.</hi> Who tells us, <hi>God <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pbraideth not; but Giveth Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> Simply. <hi>And if Any Man, want wiſdom, he ſhould ask it of God: That Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Simply.

            <p>And ſure If All True <hi>Wiſdom, be Peaceful, Gentle, Eaſy to be Intreated, full of Mercy, and Good works:</hi> It is much more So, in him: who hath <hi>All Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Meekneſs alſo.</hi> So that All <hi>Moſes Meekneſſe,</hi> was but a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle branch, or rivulet, of His Great Root, and Ocean; of Wiſdom and Meekneſſe.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Moſes</hi> could ſay, to <hi>Joſhuah, Envieſt Thou for my Sake? O that All the Lords People were Prophets! and that God would put his Spirit on them!</hi> and to God: <hi>forgive I pray thee:</hi> or elſe <hi>Blot me out of thy Book.</hi>

            <p>And was it not, the Spirit of Chriſt, that prayed ſo, in <hi>Moſes?</hi> and Other Prophets of God? ſo much Longing that All the Lords People were Prophets: and that All Might Proſper and be Safe? And was he not <hi>heard, in What he prayed?</hi> Is it not He, that ſpake in <hi>Job, and David,</hi> and the Prophets, and Apoſtles, ſighing, <hi>O that Thou hadſt Heard!</hi> and <hi>O that Thou wouldeſt hear!</hi> and <hi>Then Thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould be as the Sea, and thy Peace as the Great Rivers!</hi> and my <hi>heart is Broken with Longing, and mine eyes run down, with Rivers of Tears: becauſe They keep not thy Holy law.

               <hi>that it may flee away, and be at reſt: Mine Heart Mourneth for it; and ſhall ſound as Pipes: my Bowels yearn: and I muſt weep: and Water thee with Tears.</hi> And Thus, To <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Edom;</hi> the Worſt of Sinners; and the moſt Threatned. And <hi>would to God, that All men, were not only Almoſt, but Altogether Chriſtians: and as I am, but my bonds.</hi> And <hi>I would you knew my Earneſt Longing, and Agony; which I have to you, and to Others; even All: and as many, as have not ſeen my face, in the fleſh! and who is afflicted, and I burn not? And the Lord make you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and abound in Love, towards one another, and to All men</hi> (to All men?) <hi>As we do towards you. And I could wiſh my ſelf Accurſed for my Brethren in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it <hi>Paul</hi> only, that Said theſe things? or Chriſt in Him? and doth he not Then, both Love, and Pitty Men? and Long, For Their Good and Happineſſe? Doth he put Others only, Upon it? <hi>Will he bind Heavy Burthens,</hi> of Deſires, on Others; and not <hi>Touch them with his little finger?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it not His Spirit, that ſaith, in <hi>Job, Did I not weep for Him, that was in Trouble? and was not my Soul Grieved for the Poor?</hi> My Bowels boyled, and reſted not; I went mourning, without the Sun. If I have diſpiſed the Cauſe of my Man-Servant, or Maid-Servant, when they <hi>Contended with me</hi> (the worſt of All their Doings) <hi>what ſhall I do, when God riſeth up?</hi> and when he viſiteth? what ſhall I anſwer him? <hi>Did not One, faſhion us in the Womb?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I have eaten, my Morſel alone. <hi>If I have ſeen Any periſh,</hi> for want of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Or <hi>Any Poor,</hi> without Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If his loins have not bleſſed me. And he were not warmed with my fleece. If I have lift up my Hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fatherleſs, when I ſaw my Help wanting in the Gate. Then let my arme be broken from the bone; and fall from my ſhoulder. If I rejoyced at the deſtruction of him that <hi>Hated me:</hi> or lift up my ſelf, when <hi>Evil found him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was not All This, but a little ſhadow of the Better, larger Heart of Chriſt? ſo far beyond the Heart of <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or Any other, in the World.</p>
            <p>And yet Here alſo, we find a Tender Heart, To All, in Want and Miſery. So that <hi>Job</hi> ſtayed not, for Tears, or Intreaties: but anothers Wants, were Prayers, Loud enough. <hi>If I have ſeen Any Periſh for want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And till we come to ſee, This alſo, in the Heart of Chriſt: We ſtagger; and are ſtill, in fear; and doubt, of him. While we think, he meaſures out to us, but, as we do, to Him; and that we muſt begin to him, before His Giving out to us, or Seeking us.</p>
            <p>And yet, we ſee Gods Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Beaſts, that do not Pray at all, but with Natural Voices. Which his Pitty, doth Interpret, into <hi>Crying unto Him</hi> (As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, to the <hi>Athenians; Whom ye Ignorantly Worſhip, Him I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare:)</hi> and ſo God, to <hi>Job; Who hath eſtabliſhed Food, to the Raven?

            <p>For, he giveth <hi>Food to Every Living thing:</hi> not For its Crying, but, <hi>Becauſe his Mercy Endureth for ever.</hi> And the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and the Swallows,</hi> come, and may (or have, leave to come) <hi>and lay their eggs, and Young Ones, On his Altars: O my King and my God!</hi> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did but <hi>Chatter, as a Crane, or as a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> and yet God heard him.

            <p>And he ſaw <hi>Ahaz, Going ſoftly:</hi> though a Wicked man. And he <hi>ſeeth Affliction:</hi> and it Cryeth, Lowde in his ears.

            <p>And ſo, it was, in <hi>Aegypt.

            </p>
            <p>But we muſt ſee, This alſo, to be part of the Law: that ſo we may lay it on Chriſt: and plead it with him. And God, did not onely, ſhew us This, in his own Bowels (Promiſing, to <hi>Comfort All that mourn: and to Repleniſh Every Empty Soul; and Every ſorrowful Heart:</hi> on which the Prophets <hi>ſleep was ſweet</hi> to him:) But it was ſo, in his Heart; that now it is, alſo, a part of the Law.

            <p>But we ſee, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> praying, moſt ſweetly, Then, when he was forbidden to pray, For that People. And our Saviour had a Great Portion Given him, <hi>for pouring out his Soul for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And the Great Command He ever received, from his Father, was, to Ask Souls of him. For, it was not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but Commanded: As the Great Character, by which he ſhould be Known, and Owned, to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And ſo it is, in us, alſo.

            <p>However, it is very Clear, It was ſo required of Chriſt: and expected from him; <hi>As the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that he is Ever Asking, and Ever Receiving, from his Father: and ever Giving Out: and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152720:18"/>
This Laſt, he counts his Greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. <hi>For it is a More Bleſſed thing to Give, then to Receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he very much diſappoints, his Fathers End, and Ayme, in Sending him, into the World; or Raiſing him up, from the Dead: If he be not, Very much, in Asking, of his Father.

            <p>And That of <hi>Solomon, Open thy Mouth for the Dumb, in behalf of All Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Deſtruction;</hi> was but a little Branch of the Great Law of God, to Chriſt; <hi>Aske of Me, and I will Give thee.</hi> Moſt of All, for the poor Priſoners, and ſuch, as are Ready to Periſh.</p>
            <p>And the Pſalme, <hi>for the Afflicted,</hi> telleth us, That God looked down, From Heaven, and the hight of his Sanctuary, to hear the <hi>Groaning of the Priſoners: and to Looſe thoſe, that are Appointed to Death.</hi> It being the Great Quarrel he had, with the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> That <hi>he Smote in Anger, with a Perpetual Stroke; and made the Earth to Tremble: and did ſhake Kingdoms: and make the World a Wilderneſſe:</hi> and Then <hi>Opened not his Priſon doores, to Viſit his Priſoners, and let them go home again,</hi> As in <hi>Eſay</hi> 14. and 24. Now we All, were Priſoners; and <hi>Appointed to Dye:</hi> Till God Pleaſed to Raiſe up, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Spirit of Chriſt: which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Crying, (in the Language of the Pſalmiſt) <hi>O Let the Sighing of the Priſoner come before thee; and by the Greatneſs of thy Name or Power, Preſerve them that are Appointed to Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Unto Chriſt, it was firſt ſaid, <hi>If thou ſhalt forbear to deliver them, that are drawn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Death, and thoſe that are ready to be ſlain:</hi> If thou ſayeſt, Behold, we know it not, doth not he, that pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Heart, Conſider it? And He, that Keepeth thy Soul; doth he not know it, and will he not render, unto <hi>Every Man,</hi> (the Beſt of Men) <hi>according to his works?</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath now laid, upon his Son; or on Every Man.</p>
            <p>And what Chriſt doth, <hi>For All Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Deſtruction,</hi> is not eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But we find him Praying for All that Crucified him. As <hi>Stephen</hi> did, To Him; and by His Spirit; for All that ſtoned him. Whence <hi>Paul</hi> might learn, the Certain Character, of a Chriſtian, ſo to pray to Chriſt<hi>:</hi> As <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 14. 21, and 22. 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 2. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Wiſdom doth,</hi> and <hi>ſhall Call, to the Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, alſo. And the Man of God, muſt be Gentle: Even unto Thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves!</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our Saviour, Received, <hi>Gifts, for Rebels alſo;</hi> and ſaith, it is a more <hi>Bleſſed thing to Give, then to Receive;</hi> and that They, <hi>which Receive Freely, muſt Give Freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if God be Glorified, moſt in Us, when we bring forth Moſt Fruit (and do All the Good, we can do:) Is it not So, in Chriſt alſo? will he not do, All the Good, he may do? Or will he not Aske, All he may? Will he not have, as much as he can? and the Full Price, of his Death, and bitter Paſſion? <hi>Dyed he, as a Fool dyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were His Hands bound? or his Heart rather? and his bowels, unto Poor men? or to his Father? or his Own Glory? that he would not Aske, for All he might? Seeing it was, the Firſt, and Chiefeſt, Only, thing, his Father laid upon him: <hi>Aske and I will Give thee.</hi> Yea and Aske again: and yet again: <hi>that ſo, Thy Joy, may be Full.</hi> And I <hi>never ſpeak, but What, the Father ſpoke to Me: and As, the Father, ſpoke to Mee.</hi> the Great Key, to open All the Bible.</p>

And the Prophet was diſpleaſed, that the <hi>King of Iſrael ſhot but Thrice.</hi> And ſure, we may plead it with Chriſt; that he bids us, <hi>Pray Continually:</hi> and be <hi>Ever Asking, that we may receive.</hi> And it is backed, with This For: <hi>For, Every One that Asketh, ſhall Receive.</hi> And may we not ſay to him, <hi>Aske us of the Father, and he will Give us to thee.

            <p>And how he Asked; or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Took his Asking: We may See, by Gods Giving; and His Receiving; What was Promiſed, upon his Asking. <hi>Even All Nations, for his Inheritance; and the utmoſt ends of the Earth, for His Poſſeſſion.</hi>

            <p>Yea, and to ſuſtain, his Spirit, in his Dying Pangs, upon the Croſſe: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. it is expreſly promiſed, that <hi>All the Ends of the World ſhall Remember and Turn unto the Lord: and All Kings, and Nations, ſhall worſhip before him.</hi> For he is the <hi>Bleſſing to all Nations; and to Every Family.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>All Nations, ſhall come, and Glorifie Thy Name: For, It is Holy.</hi> And in many Places, <hi>His Holineſs,</hi> is the Great Cauſe, and Object, of All our Praiſing him: and yet, <hi>All ſhall Praiſe him, and his Holy Name.</hi> So that he, is bold, <hi>to Swear by himſelf,</hi> (which he would not do, If there had been a <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelf) That Every Knee ſhould how to Him:</hi> and yet, to the <hi>Glory of the Father.

            </p>
            <p>And in his Great Prayer, he ſaith, <hi>As thou haſt Given him Power, Over All fleſh: that he ſhould Give Eternal Life to as many as Thou haſt Given him.

            <p>Yet, before the End, he doth alſo pray, for Others; whom at firſt, He did not Pray for. And how many might come, into the Latter End, of That Prayer, I know not. Or how many may come, to <hi>Believe on him; by Their Word.</hi>

            <p>And when King <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou doeſt almoſt perſwade me to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> he replyed, I <hi>would to God, not only Thou, but All, that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am: except theſe bonds.

            <p>And when he requireth <hi>Prayers For All Men;</hi> he plainly ſaith; <hi>This was Good, and Acceptable, unto God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

VVho gave himſelf, a Ranſome For All; to be Teſtified in Its Proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> As the Words are.</p>
            <p>For, as <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>He is not willing, that Any ſhould Periſh; but that All, ſhould come, to Repentance. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Long ſuffering of God, to be Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: As our beloved Brother Paul hath written to you.</hi> As before.</p>
            <p>Whence was All This Striving, and Longing, in <hi>Paul,</hi> or Any other, for the Salvation of All men? but from His Spirit, who promiſed, to <hi>Draw All men to him?</hi> and though we do not yet ſee it done: we may Remember, who alſo ſaid, <hi>we do not yet ſee, All things, Put under him:</hi> which yet muſt be.</p>
            <p>Nor may we think, he offereth, Any thing to Men, but what he Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſireth, they ſhould take, and enjoy. For, he bids us, <hi>not to eat the bread, of Him, that hath an evill eye:</hi> Saying, <hi>Eat and Drink, When his Heart is not ſo.</hi> And he, that hateth Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, ſo much in Others: Sure will hate it more, in himſelf. and He that ſweareth, <hi>he hath no Pleaſure, in the Death of a Wicked man, but that he Turn, and Live:</hi> is very Active alſo, in the uſe of means, to turn him; and Reall in it. <hi>Deviſing meanes, that his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed alſo, may not Periſh, but return to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as, It is Said, <hi>He doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict from his Heart:</hi> ſo, when ever he doth afflict, or puniſh, his Greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, As <hi>Moab, Ammon, Edom;</hi> yet he doth it <hi>Weeping.</hi> So, his <hi>Heart doth mourn for Moab: and his Bowels yearn: and are Pained for him. And his fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhall flee to Zoar,</hi> As his Father <hi>Lot,</hi> from <hi>Sodom.</hi> And the <hi>Heifer of</hi> 3 <hi>year old,</hi> may allude to the Covenant made, with <hi>Lot and Abraham</hi> (as the Turtle and the Pigeon) in Gen 15. 9. As the <hi>Lot, or Veile,</hi> in Eſay 25, To Gen. 13. 14. And he pitties <hi>Edoms Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Children;</hi> As the <hi>Daughters of Zelophehad,</hi> Though their Father <hi>Dyed in his Sin.</hi> And ſo he <hi>Wept, over Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> And in <hi>Judgment, ſtill remembreth Mercy.</hi> As his Throne is White; and yet the World will run away.

And as the Law requireth, <hi>that the King</hi> (even when he ſate, upon the <hi>Throne of his Kingdom) ſhould Write out the Law, and read it, and keep it, All his dayes: that he might not exalt himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Brethren; but might ſo, prolong his Kingdom:</hi> So</p>
            <p>When he was Brought, In Great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, to ſit upon the <hi>White Throne of his Kingdom,</hi> in the Revelation: He biddeth it be <hi>Written, As a moſt True, Saying of God: Behold,</hi> I <hi>make All things New.</hi>

            <p>And, it may mind us, of That ſtrict Injunction (on their coming, to enjoy their Promiſed Land) to Break down <hi>All Idols, Groves, and Temples: with High Places, and Images: and what ever, was, or might be, any meane, or Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to Idolatry, or Superſtition.</hi> So that They might follow none, of the <hi>Old manners, of the Land before them:</hi> In Worſhip of Their Gods: or of the <hi>True God in their manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, the Lord, declares himſelf As Strict, or more, in <hi>Manner</hi> of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then in <hi>Matter.</hi> Or as Jealous, in the Matter of the 2d Command, or more, then in the Firſt, Which hath not, That note of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> which the 2d hath.</p>
            <p>And yet This alſo, ſpringeth from Love: Being as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, a <hi>Godly Jealouſie: Leaſt having E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed us to one husband, We ſhould wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the flocks of his Corrivals.</hi> And for This alſo, we are bid to call <hi>Wiſdom, our Siſter;</hi> that ſhe may <hi>preſerve us, from the deceiving flattering Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Chriſt, hath alſo undertaken All This; to God and Man, alſo. So to Declare, the True, and Right way, of worſhipping, the Only True God; that There ſhall be, <hi>No more Idol,</hi> or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.

            <p>We are come to Chriſts <hi>Peculiars;</hi> and his Proper Work. As <hi>Heyr of the World:</hi> As the <hi>Seed of Ab.</hi> and the 2d <hi>Adam.</hi> As the Firſt, was in the Image of God; and Therefore, made to Rule. <hi>Let us make man in our Image, and after our Likeneſs; and let Them have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> As if This, did only follow, That.</p>
            <p>And though the Prophets call it, the Kingdom of God; and <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven:</hi> Yet it is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on Earth. And ſo, the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> plain enough. For, God doth Reign in Heaven ſtill; and ſo he will, upon Earth: but In, and By, and Through a man. And therefore, he hath Given Chriſt, <hi>All Judgment: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> For, God will Judge us by our <hi>Peers.</hi> And <hi>He hath Given Earth to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the Baptiſt, and our Saviour, and Apoſtles, preached, that the <hi>Kingdom was at Hand, or Coming:</hi> Yet, it was not Come. And Chriſt doth never call himſelf a <hi>King,</hi> Till his 2d coming. Then, the <hi>Son of Man, ſhall ſend, His Angels:</hi> (which before, he calls, <hi>his Fathers Angels: and the Holy Angels:)</hi> to gather out of <hi>His Kingdom.</hi> And, the <hi>King ſhall ſay, Come ye Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> and the <hi>King ſhall ſay, Go ye Curſed.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, about <hi>Camillus</hi> Time, we find their <hi>Hours,</hi> in <hi>Livy. Watches,</hi> in their Ancient Laws, and Hiſtories. As <hi>Scipio,</hi> came to <hi>Trebia,</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> Watch. <hi>Hanibal,</hi> for <hi>Tarentum,</hi> at the <hi>4th</hi> Watch. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> fled To <hi>Sardis,</hi> by Midnight: and to <hi>Apamea,</hi> by the <hi>4th</hi> Watch. <hi>Craſſus</hi> jeſted at <hi>Dejotarus,</hi> Building in the <hi>4th</hi> Watch: or <hi>11th</hi> Hour of his Life.</p>
            <p>The Little Watches, had but 3 Hours, a piece. (Though ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for 4; and a <hi>Middle Watch,</hi> in <hi>Judges:)</hi> As, our Saviours Twelve Hours, parted, at the 3<hi>d,</hi> and 6<hi>t,</hi> and <hi>9th.</hi> And ſo, the <hi>Watchers</hi> (which is <hi>Daniels</hi> word:) Cryed, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> Thrice: As 3 Hours, in a <hi>Watch.</hi> But Antient Copies, have it, 9 times: the <hi>ſquare</hi> of 3: and both, were Sacred, to Others alſo; For their 3 <hi>Graces,</hi> and 9 Muſes.</p>
            <p>And, as 1 and 2, make 3: and 3 more, 6 (or twice 3:) So the Sum of Theſe 3, differs, from the next 3, by 9. and the 3<hi>d</hi> 3, maketh 24. As the 3<hi>d</hi> from it, 42 (which is 24, Turned) 24, and 42, make 66. As the <hi>7th</hi> 3: 60. and the <hi>8th,</hi> 69. For, the Summes, differ All by 9. And They are, Up and down (or forward and backward) the Same figures, 0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. As in this Table.</p>
            <p>1. 2. 3. = 06.</p>

            <p>For, the Little Watches, of their ſhorteſt Day, had but 2 hours and half: and their Longeſt, 3 and an half: which was ſignal with Them alſo, for daily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and for the Paſſeover: at 3 hours and half, from Noon.

1260 Days, in 42 months. But they ſay, that if the New Moon were ſeen in the <hi>30th</hi> Day; It was counted for the firſt, of the Month following. But of late, the <hi>Jews</hi> go by <hi>Mean Motions:</hi> and account 59 Dayes, For 2 Months. Short of the True <hi>Middle Motion,</hi> by an Hour, and about 29 minutes.</p>
            <p>And though they found a way, to reconcile their <hi>Lunar</hi> months, To the <hi>Solar</hi> year: we need it not. For, God hath bounded out our way, by Dayes: when Ever the year began. For, the firſt <hi>14th</hi> Day, was the <hi>Paſsover:</hi> and <hi>15th</hi> the Feaſt of Unleavened Bread (for 7 Days more:) and <hi>16th,</hi> for the Firſt fruit <hi>Omer:</hi> and the <hi>50th</hi> next, was <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> And the Feaſt of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> was the firſt: <hi>Atonement,</hi> the <hi>10th:</hi> and <hi>Tabernacles, 15th,</hi> of the <hi>7th</hi> month of their year, when Ever it began. Which From <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> was about the <hi>New Moon, next the Vernal Equinox:</hi> which muſt be Paſt, they ſay, before the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> But we need not diſpute it. Though it might be cleared, by their beſt Authors: and by <hi>Anatolius,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius:</hi> As of late, by <hi>Petitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak, (they ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo, by Crucifying Chriſt) They were forced, To the <hi>Julian</hi> Form alſo. Yet they kept their Feaſts, by <hi>Moons:</hi> and made them Tables, much like <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> In other things, they could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Julian</hi> year: and the rather, becauſe the 6 odd Hours, in ſingle years, did keep their Equinox, at a Cardinal point; or one of their Great <hi>Watches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But others, kept the 6 odd Hours, Till they made a Day: and ſo, the <hi>4th</hi> year, was <hi>Biſſextile:</hi> from the 6<hi>t Calends</hi> of <hi>March</hi> (or <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>February)</hi> Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. That the Dayes of the week, or <hi>Feriae,</hi> might keep their wonted letters, in the Common <hi>Cycle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is Greater Harmony, by <hi>Julian</hi> years in 4. then ſeemeth to be known, to them that firſt uſed it.</p>
            <p>For, as the <hi>4th Watch</hi> of Creation, brought up the Firſt Light; and the <hi>4th Day,</hi> the Firſt Sun; and the <hi>4th Week,</hi> the Moon, to meet the Sun again: ſo, the <hi>4th Year,</hi> brings them to meet in the ſame Day of the Week: and is not 2 <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> more or leſs, then 14 dayes, above the <hi>Jubilie</hi> of 49 <hi>Moons.</hi> Which ſtill return, To the ſame Day of the Week.</p>
            <p>And 8 years, have 3 <hi>minutes</hi> more, then a full month of Weeks, above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 98 <hi>Moons:</hi> Or a day and half, with 41 <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> leſs then 99. So that, in 8 <hi>ſcore years,</hi> they want, but one day, and one Hower, of meeting; as before: and in 1600 years, but 10 days, and 10 Howers.</p>
            <p>So that, meeting, on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and 10 Houers, after noon, in the Firſt of Chriſt: They met again, in 1601: the Firſt of <hi>May,</hi> juſt at noon.</p>
            <p>And parting, the years of Chriſt by 4 (and ſo, the <hi>Julian Period,</hi> After 9, or rejecting 9:) The <hi>Remainder</hi> ſheweth how long, the year propoſed, is After a <hi>Biſſextile:</hi> And the <hi>Quotient</hi> ſheweth, that the Sun and Moon met, ſo many <hi>fortnights,</hi> from their former meeting, As there be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nits,</hi> in that <hi>Quotient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being added, To the year propoſed; and All divided by 7: The <hi>Remainder,</hi> is the Day, of the Week, for the Firſt of <hi>May</hi> (And by conſequence, for the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ap.</hi> and <hi>July: 4th</hi> of <hi>Septemb</hi> and <hi>Decemb. 5th</hi> of <hi>June:</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Novemb.)</hi> For the year propoſed: And, for the firſt, 8. 15. 22. and 29. of <hi>January</hi> following: and ſo forward, in the next year alſo.</p>
            <p>But if nothing remain, at this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,</hi> by 7, The firſt of <hi>May</hi> (and every Day aforeſaid) is the <hi>7th</hi> Day, of the Week; the Jewiſh <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, we get the Days of the Week, for 2 years together: and the <hi>Mean</hi>

               <hi>Synods, and Luminations.</hi> Which are Equall; and may differ, from the <hi>Viſible,</hi> by 14 Hours: or as much, as the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Day, at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The Great Sun Dyall, To the World.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Eclipſes</hi> alſo. The Moons <hi>Latitude,</hi> is much alike in 4 years: and the Suns <hi>Anomaly,</hi> returns, in 4 years. And 4, <hi>Julian</hi> years, have juſt 1461 Days: As the Great Egyptian <hi>Soth,</hi> had 1461 years.</p>
            <p>But if any chooſe another way of <hi>Epact.</hi> The <hi>Arabick Lunar</hi> year, is juſt, 10 <hi>dayes and</hi> 21 <hi>hours,</hi> leſs, then the <hi>Solar:</hi> of 365 <hi>dayes,</hi> 5 <hi>hours, and</hi> 48 <hi>minutes.</hi> But the Common <hi>Julian,</hi> Greater, then 12 <hi>Moons;</hi> by 10 <hi>dayes,</hi> 10 <hi>hours,</hi> 10 <hi>halfs, and</hi> 10 <hi>minutes.</hi> And the <hi>Lunar</hi> month, about a <hi>day and half, half hour, and quarter,</hi> more, then a month, of 4 <hi>Weeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Lunar</hi> year, is thus, too long, by 10 or 12 minutes, yet it ſuits the <hi>Julian:</hi> which is ſo much <hi>alſo,</hi> too long. So that, the <hi>Equinox,</hi> is changed, from Evening to Morning, in 65 years. Which may be one, of many reaſons, for the 65 days of the year, in <hi>Canaan:</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> placeth at 65 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Longitude.</hi>

            <p>And From <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> To the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, there were as many years as Days in a year: or Hours From That 23<hi>d</hi> of the 3<hi>d</hi> To the <hi>9th</hi> of the <hi>4th:</hi> on which They Faſt for the City Taken: as in <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Jeremy.</hi> Which was, from the firſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as many Hours, As years, from the Firſt <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> To that Captivity<hi>:</hi> about 860.</p>

            <p>And as the month had 30 days, and then the Moon is Hid, (as the Firſt Light was hid in 30 Hours:) So the Ark, had 30 Cubits Height.

            </p>
            <p>In 636, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is Sacked by <hi>Omar,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> by <hi>Sigebert</hi> (a King, and ere long a Monk) <hi>Chriſtiana factia &amp; Catholica.</hi> In 637, we read of <hi>Pariſhes</hi> (as <hi>Cambden:)</hi> but an old <hi>Mſs</hi> brings them, To <hi>Theodore,</hi> about 666.</p>

            <p>Their ſetling All the Power, of the Pope Here, upon the Crown; might be a <hi>Reverter,</hi> of what was There before (As often Adjudged<hi>:)</hi> Yet I know not, that Ever before, the K. was left, to the Diſcretion of Cant (which had the <hi>Pall and Belt;</hi> or Great Symboles, of Dependance on Rome, and Homage to it:) As the Statute leaves him: For <hi>Licenſes and Diſpenſations</hi> (and others of the Popes <hi>Peculiers:) If the Arch-biſhop judge it meet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But After Times, did help the Crown, by giving it leave, To make its Biſhops by a Patent: As <hi>Edward the</hi> 6<hi>t</hi> had made a preaching Sheriff: or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch things; with Collations: and receiving Reſignations; To moſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Cures.</p>

            <p>And the Dragon purſued the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, flying to the Wilderneſſe (As <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> did: and is in <hi>Bondage with her ſeed</hi> To This day: as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) and made war with her ſeed.</p>

As many <hi>Femimine Beaſts:</hi> Or Mother of All the Beaſts: <hi>As Wiſdom is of All her Children:</hi> and yet ſhe alſo, is <hi>Plural,</hi> in Heb.

            <p>The <hi>Dragon</hi> is Prince of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> (as it walks in <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> while the Beaſts are Couching:) and the ſhorteſt night of Darkneſs, in <hi>Iudea,</hi> was of 10 Hours, or Horns; as of 7 Heads, or Dayes, in a week.</p>
            <p>And if their ſhorteſt Day, or Night, be as 1000 years (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. and 91. of the <hi>Dragon and Beaſts:)</hi> Then is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Hour, as 100 years. And ſo, the <hi>Dragon and Beaſt,</hi> muſt Reign, about 1330 years<hi>:</hi> As They Reigned, 133 Hours, before <hi>Adam</hi> was Created.</p>
            <p>And if the whole Day and Night, be As 1000, Then the Longeſt time of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> in the Bible <hi>Meridian,</hi> is but 666<hi>:</hi> or 2 thirds of 1000; As one third of 2000.</p>
            <p>But if their Little <hi>Watches,</hi> alſo, be 1000 (as the Pſalm hinteth) Then is Every Hour, 333. And ſo <hi>Platoes</hi> third part of an hour, may be 111. which is alſo, the number of <hi>Kaveh:</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Heb word, for a <hi>Meaſuring Line.</hi> And Thus, 666, may be paralel to the 6 Hours Turns of <hi>Tide, and Sun and Moon,</hi> at the <hi>Cardinal</hi> points of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: As before.</p>
            <p>And the Jewes parted all their hours, into as many <hi>Clakins,</hi> as days in 3 years: 1080. and each of them by as many more as their <hi>Sanhedrin:</hi> or <hi>Noahs</hi> Nephews<hi>:</hi> or their Families, in Egypt<hi>:</hi> Or our Saviours Anceſtors, in <hi>Luke:</hi> Or years of <hi>Abrahams</hi> coming to <hi>Canaan.</hi> and 75, is the difference, between 1260 &amp; 1335. but 3 more then Twice 666.</p>

            <p>The 42 Months, are 1260 Dayes: as 5 months, of the <hi>Firſt Wo,</hi> are 150 days As the 5 firſt months of the <hi>Flood,</hi> quite hiding the Earth, in Water<hi>:</hi> as the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> Mother, was Hidden, 5 months: and in the 6<hi>t,</hi> the Angel came to the, Virgin.</p>
            <p>And at 30 Dayes apiece, 42 Months, are 1260 Dayes: As the Dayes of the <hi>Woman:</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> alſo, 42 months. And yet, they do not ſeem to end together.

            <p>And at Riſing of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> part only, of the City fell: whether it be the <hi>Great City</hi> following (which <hi>Reigned over the Kings of the Earth:)</hi> Or the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City</hi> Before: yet called <hi>Sodom, where the Lord was ſlain.</hi> As in the Prophets.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152720:42"/>
And the <hi>10th</hi> of that City, may allude To <hi>Neehmiahs</hi> Time. <hi>When the Tenths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of All the people, were choſen out by lot,</hi> to <hi>dwell in Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo that All that City was but, as the <hi>Tenth</hi> of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Tenth</hi> (in Eſay 6, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places) ſeems a Type of Gods <hi>Elect:</hi> Or elſe there may be ſomewhat more, in it. For, the <hi>Firſt Fruits,</hi> are <hi>The Elect:</hi> whoſe <hi>Heb</hi> name, is akin to That, of <hi>Firſt Fruits.</hi> As we touch on Davids <hi>Micol,</hi> and <hi>Baburim:</hi> in another place.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tenths,</hi> are proper moſt, to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church. And when the <hi>Fruits,</hi> of All the Earth, come in (as <hi>All King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:</hi> At the Riſing of the <hi>Witneſſes:)</hi> It is no great wonder, That <hi>Tenths</hi> ſhould <hi>Fall.</hi> With All, the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pendants, To the <hi>Iewiſh Levites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the very word for <hi>Dragon,</hi> is in Hebrew, <hi>Tan</hi> [or <hi>Tannin]</hi> and <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi> akin, to <hi>Levi Tan,</hi> or <hi>Ten:</hi> And the <hi>Levites</hi> crying, <hi>Ten, Ten;</hi> which is <hi>Give, Give,</hi> (as the <hi>Horſleach:) Elſe I will Take it, with This Fleſhook: by Force.</hi> And <hi>Levitan,</hi> may be, <hi>Levi the Dragon:</hi> or <hi>Cruel Levi.</hi> As Their Father <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid. Adding alſo, <hi>But my ſoul ſhall not be in their Secret,</hi> or in <hi>Sodam</hi> (As the word is There: and maketh juſt 666:) alluding unto <hi>Lots,</hi> flying out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> to <hi>Zoar.</hi> As <hi>Moab,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> is bidden, in Eſay 16. As, to mind, the <hi>Heifer of</hi> 3 <hi>years old,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> told the <hi>Levites,</hi> they were a ſtiff, Rebellious Generation. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 25. 27. And it was a <hi>Levites Concubine,</hi> that plaid the Whore, at <hi>Bethlem:</hi> Till at length, ſhe was filled; and divided into 12. As the 10, and 2 Tribes<hi>:</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all about<hi>:</hi> Till there were not left 666, Reliques of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> And yet, he Had the <hi>Ruler, Saul</hi> (and He cut his Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, As the <hi>Levites Concubine:)</hi> and then the Temple came, in <hi>Little Benjamin. The Lord muſt dwell between His ſhoulders.</hi> And the Altar had a corner cut, that ſo it might be all in <hi>Benjamin.</hi> To <hi>Devour the Prey, in the morning</hi> ſacrifice; and to gnaw <hi>the Bones, in the Evening:</hi> As Jacob firſt; and Then, the Prophets do allude.</p>
            <p>And the Jews obſerve, the <hi>Levites</hi> were but 22000, to Teach their 22 <hi>Letters:</hi> &amp; for neglecting That, They were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captive, in their 22<hi>d</hi> Generation. As the Prieſts, cut off, by <hi>Saul:</hi> Before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids New Jeruſalem:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> Put off, <hi>Abiathar</hi> alſo: the Relique of the Prieſts. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> chaſed a Son of the High Prieſt, allied to <hi>Samballat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Solomon</hi> came to <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Temple</hi> (which perhaps, the Prieſts expected: But) <hi>As ſoon, As all the people</hi> did agree, to Bleſſe the Lord, and ſing, <hi>For he is Good: Becauſe</hi> (a mighty word! As if, He were not <hi>Good, But That) His Mercy doth Endure for Ever:</hi> Then, the Glory of God, came Down, and Filled the Temple ſo, that the very Beſt, of All the Prieſts, could not Enter: or Durſt not.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Solomon</hi> was fain, to Pray <hi>(will God Indeed, Indeed, come Dwell in Clay?)</hi> and Bleſſe the People. Which by Gods Command, was moſt Peculier, to the Sons of <hi>Aaron:</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> was neither Prieſt, nor <hi>Levite;</hi> But of <hi>Judah, whence our Lord did ſpring.</hi> And he cut off, 22000 Beaſts, in One Day<hi>:</hi> which Themſelves compare, to the 22000 <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> Adding alſo, that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſlew 22000, about the Temple; and was Beaten, after it, by <hi>Caeſars</hi> 22000; To as many more, in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Army. As 22000, in That of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> in the <hi>Machabes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Joaſh</hi> came up, in the <hi>7th</hi> year, and did deſire, the <hi>Levites,</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Temple:</hi> or to help it forward: They Pretended, but 'tis ſaid, <hi>They Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned it not.</hi> And again, in Twice 7 years, <hi>The Prieſts, had not Repaired the Houſe:</hi> as 2 Kings 12. with 2 Cron. 24. (as 12, and 24, in all, Temple mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152720:42"/>
And at length, They conſent, <hi>to Receive no more money: nor to Repair the Houſe:</hi> which was therefore, Put out (as the <hi>Vineyard)</hi> To Other perſons: That did work; and <hi>do it, Faithfully:</hi> without <hi>Prieſts and Levites.</hi> Which might be, a Type of ſomewhat in our Saviours Times; and Farther. And though, we read, of <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> ſtill: Even in <hi>Ezechiels New Ieruſalem:</hi> Yet of <hi>Tithes,</hi> very Seldom, or never, that I find, in all the Bible, of the <hi>Goſtel Times:</hi> but of the Phariſees Boaſt, of <hi>Paying Tithes:</hi> and <hi>Tithing Mint,</hi> or <hi>Any-ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Tenth,</hi> might alſo Note, <hi>The Tribute,</hi> Paid to Kings, over them: Which <hi>Samuel</hi> fixed by the <hi>Tenth,</hi> of All they had, or Got. And when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Took the <hi>Didragm</hi> (or <hi>half ſhekle, For Redemption of Souls:</hi> As in <hi>Matthew,</hi> with <hi>Joſephus:)</hi> They had <hi>Tithes</hi> alſo<hi>:</hi> The Common <hi>Tribute,</hi> to <hi>Hercules,</hi> with other Demigods. And ſo the <hi>10th</hi> days of all, or divers, months, were mourning faſting Dayes: as we ſaw before.</p>
            <p>And thus, the <hi>Fall of the Tenth of the City</hi> (Whither it be <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or Any Other: or All Others: For it may be, in All, Succeſſively:) may ſpeak the Fall, of All Their <hi>Tolls,</hi> and <hi>Tributes, Tythes,</hi> and <hi>Offerings:</hi> or whatever elſe, was Appendant to the <hi>Levitical Policy:</hi> or mearly <hi>Jewiſh:</hi> Or <hi>Legal Bonds:</hi> or Bondage.

            <p>But <hi>Ezechiels</hi> New Altar, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the Old Levites, that ſtayed with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and Chooſeth the Houſe of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doch</hi> (the <hi>Righteous)</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> took him, for <hi>Abiathar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 45, determines All Tribute, to their King, alſo: with a ſtrikt Command, upon the Prince: <hi>To Take away his Exactions, on his People.</hi> whoſe <hi>Exactors muſt be Peace.</hi> And One of 200, Lambs, with a <hi>60th</hi> part of Corn<hi>:</hi> or 100 part, of Oyle<hi>:</hi> is Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Tribute.</p>
            <p>But How Long, Theſe <hi>Tenths,</hi> or other <hi>Tolls,</hi> may laſt: I know not any Text, determines clearer, Then the <hi>14th</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Bringing us, To the Feaſt, of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> (in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters:) After <hi>Harveſt, and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi> As <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 16, and 34. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
            <p>As the Ark came Home (From 7 <hi>Months Wandring:</hi> as 7 years <hi>Releaſe:) and Reſted in the Field of Joſuah,)</hi> ſome Type of <hi>Jeſus:)</hi> when the Jews were At Their <hi>Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Laſt Harveſt.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Showers fell<hi>:</hi> that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, in <hi>Harveſt</hi> (As 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. and 12. 17. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 10.)

            <p>
               <hi>And the Blood</hi> (As <hi>Moſes</hi> Song, The <hi>Blood of Grapes) came up, to the Bridles of the Horſes:</hi> Tredding it (as, in the 2<hi>d Woe:) and it flowed out, From the City</hi> (Trod and Preſſed) 1600 <hi>Furlongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if <hi>Cubits,</hi> be proper for <hi>Days;</hi> Then, <hi>Furlongs,</hi> are proper, for <hi>Years.</hi> And ſo, we may find them, in Many Places<hi>:</hi> and Cities Built, and Sackt, or Changed, at a ſignal Number of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> (or <hi>Miles)</hi> in their own Buildings<hi>:</hi> or Diſtance, to ſome others<hi>:</hi> ſo, or ſo, Related to them. <hi>As the Olbian Tables, and Characters.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Then, the Jewiſh year, had near 400 Days. And ſo, the word, for 2 <hi>years ſpace,</hi> is, 800. If <hi>m,</hi> be only 40, in <hi>Shenothaim.</hi>

            <p>And the Ancients, meaſured a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> by 666 Furlongs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Revelation,</hi> was at <hi>Patmos;</hi> a <hi>Greek Iland.</hi> Somewhat before 100, of Chriſt: or 60, from His Paſſion<hi>:</hi> or 30, from the City Sack.

            <p>And our Saviour hints, ſomewhat in <hi>Furlongs.</hi> When They had <hi>Rowed</hi> 30 <hi>Furlongs</hi> (as Himſelf, had lived, 30 years<hi>:)</hi> They fell, into a very Great
